ACT ONE
In DARKNESS the sound of a meadowlark's song.
FADE IN:
THE MEADOWLARK
The bright eye and beak of the bird, backlit by the first
light of the rising sun.
EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY "21" - DAWN
A long, straight, empty stretch of road leads up between two
mountains, Whitetail and Blue Pine, the Twin Peaks.
EXT. TWIN PEAKS TOWN SQUARE - DAWN
The picturesque center of the town of Twin Peaks; a small,
neatly manicured park with a pristine white gazebo its
centerpiece. Fronting the park is the '30's-style streamlined,
concrete and glass City Hall. An early rising MAN walks two
Irish setters through the square.
EXT. TWIN PEAKS DOWNTOWN - DAWN
In the shadow of a smaller mountain Sparkwood Hill, we see
the slightly run down business district, the core of Twin
Peaks' old downtown. A slow-moving freight train rumbles
through the train station.
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN
A quiet, tree-lined street. White, clapboard houses with
open porches. A MILKMAN carries a crate of clinking milk
bottles up the steps to one of the houses. Behind him, a
yellow schoolbus cruises slowly by.
EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN
Where Sparkwood Road meets Highway "21", a traffic light
cycles from green to yellow to red.
EXT. ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - DAWN
On the highway. Not yet open for business. - No sign of life.

EXT. THE ROADHOUSE DANCE HALL - DAWN
A dog drifts through a parking lot, littered with last night's
trash and beer bottles. The club's neon patron-snatcher
flickers back and forth between two images of a couple doing
the jitterbug.
EXT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - DAWN
Open for business. Two Diesel rigs idle in the oil-stained
gravel lot outside. A couple of nighthawks sober up at the
counter. A pretty country-western ballad plays on the jukebox
inside.
EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAWN
An imposing granite structure overlooks the city from high
on White Tail Mountain, one of the Twin Peaks. Automatic
sprinklers kick on across the vast green-black lawns.
EXT. PACKARD SAWMILL - DAWN
A massive industrial structure on the south shore of Black
Lake. Sawdust and steam shoot out of funnels and pipes. A
distant tug shepherds a logjam towards the sawmill gates. A
piercing steam whistle signals the end of the night shift.
EXT. THE PACKARD RESIDENCE - DAWN
Outside the huge log house, called Blue Pine Lodge, PETE
MARTELL, a late-middle-aged man, sets some fishing gear in
the back of a pick-up, then goes inside.
INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - DAWN
Pete grabs a thermos of coffee and an apple, kisses his wife,
KATHERINE PACKARD MARTELL, a sturdy, weathered woman, midfifties, fully dressed, at the table, newspaper and coffee
in hand. She doesn't react to the kiss. Pete exits.
CUT TO:
INT. BLUE PINE LODGE MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN.
GIOVANNA PASQUALINI PACKARD, a beautiful woman in her

 
thirties, wearing a silk negligee, sits at a vanity table,
combing her hair, lost in a dreamy state of mind. From
outside, she hears Pete's pick-up drive off, turns to look
out the bedroom's large picture window.
CUT TO:
GIOVANNA'S POV
Looking down to the shores of Black Lake. A large logjam is
visible near the sawmill dock.
CUT TO:
EXT. SAWMILL DOCK - DAWN
Pete lifts his fishing gear from the pick-up end walks out
onto the dock to drop a line.
CUT TO:
PETE
He's about to cast out his line when his expression changes;
he sees something horrible. He sets his tackle and makes his
way down a wooden stairway to a landing at water level. He
jumps across a gap of dark, oil-slicked water onto the edge
of a cabled log-raft. He steps cautiously across the shiny,
barkless logs, slowing as he approaches what it was that
caught his eye...
CUT TO:
A WOMAN'S BODY
Face down, lying on the log raft, cut, bruised, broken and
lifeless.
PETE
Shaking, he turns to go for help.
CUT TO:

 
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE - DAY
Highway "21", empty, running up between the twin peaks. A
flying wedge of motorcycle riders driving Harleys ride into
view; seven young men, all between seventeen and twenty-one,
clean-cut, wearing black leather jackets. With MAIN TITLES
and MUSIC over, we see the gang ride through various parts
of the city.
END TITLES
FADE IN:
EXT. SAWMILL DOCK - DAWN
Pete, the middle-aged man, hurriedly punches in a number on
a pay phone at the end of the dock.
PETE
Lucy, put Dan on the horn.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN
SHERIFF DAN STEADMAN, rugged, early forties, pours his first
cup of coffee, as the dispatcher, LUCY MORAN, turns to him
from the switchboard.
LUCY
Sheriff, sounds like Pete Martell up
at the Mill.
Steadman punches line one and picks up the call.
STEADMAN
Sheriff Steadman... now hold on a
second, Pete, where?... you stay
right there, I'm on my way.
He hangs up, grabs his hat and coat and heads for the door.
STEADMAN
(to Lucy)
You better get Dr. Hayward, tell him
(more)

 
STEADMAN (cont.)
to meet me up at the Packard Mill,
the dock right below the dam - and
roust that Andy out of bed, tell him
to get his butt up there now.
LUCY
What is it?
STEADMAN
We got a body up there. You don't
say a word to anybody till you hear
from me.
Steadman exits.
CUT TO:
EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN
Steadman hops into his souped-up Diamond County Sheriff's
Department cruiser, fires up the big V-8 and rooster-tails
it towards the highway, as his red and blue toplights start
spinning.
CUT TO:
EXT. PACKARD MILL DOCK - MORNING
Steadman pulls up, lights still spinning, just as the Diamond
County Coroner's station wagon pulls up alongside. Steadman
gets out and joins DR. WILLIAM HAYWARD, the Medical Examiner,
a tall, distinguished gray-haired man of sixty, and they
move towards the dock.
HAYWARD
What've we got?
STEADMAN
Let's go find out.
They make their way down the wooden steps to the log raft.
Waiting there are Pete, his wife Katherine and Giovanna
Packard, wearing a coat over a brocade bathrobe, her beautiful
hair and make-up in stark contrast to the harsh surroundings.

 
PETE
We haven't touched anything.
STEADMAN
Thanks, Pete.
(tips his hat)
Mrs. Packard... Katherine...
KATHERINE
Our security guard didn't see
anything.
Steadman nods, he and Hayward move forward to the body, on
the edge of the logs. Without touching anything, Hayward
kneels beside the body and begins to examine details.
HAYWARD
You want forensics first?
STEADMAN
(shakes his head)
She's been in the water. Go ahead.
HAYWARD
Let's get some pictures.
Above them, on the dock, DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN, young,
intelligent but awkward and shy, climbs down the stairs,
carrying a forensic examination kit and a camera.
ANDY
You need the kit, Sheriff? I've got
the kit.
STEADMAN
Good. Bring that camera down here,
Andy.
ANDY
Right.
(as he passes the
others)
Ladies... Pete.

 
STEADMAN
Doc wants some pictures before we
turn her over.
ANDY
(staring at the body)
Who is she?
STEADMAN
Andy, the camera. Then we'll turn
her over and find out.
ANDY
Sorry. Sure. Okay.
Andy puts down the kit and shoots various angles of her back,
as the others stand out of the way. Andy kneels down to get
a closer shot, pauses, slumps back down to a sitting position
and starts to weep.
HAYWARD
Oh, Andy.
STEADMAN
My God, Andy. Same thing as Last
year in Mr. Blodgett's barn.
ANDY
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
STEADMAN
Is this gonna happen every damn time?
HAYWARD
Give me the camera, Andy.
Hayward takes the camera from him and takes some more
pictures. Steadman notices that a crowd of mill workers are
gathering above on the dock.
STEADMAN
(giving him an out)
Andy, get up on the dock and dear
that crowd back.

 
ANDY
Okay, Dan. Sorry.
Drying his eyes, Andy walks back and starts up the ladder.
Hayward takes a closeup of the girl's wrist, where he's found
some small, distinctive wounds. He puts the camera down on
the forensic kit.
HAYWARD
Let's turn her over. Give me a hand
here.
Steadman and Hayward grasp her by the shoulders and knees
end gently turn the body over.
CUT TO:
THE GIRL'S HEAD
As the body turns and the face comes into view.
CUT TO:
STEADMAN AND HAYWARD
Seeing the face, they're both hit with a shock of recognition.
HAYWARD
Oh Lord. Laura...
STEADMAN
Laura Palmer.
HAYWARD
Sweet Jesus...
GIOVANNA
(shocked)
Laura? Is it Laura?
Steadman looks back towards the others, where Giovanna has
stepped forward towards them. He catches her eye. Nods.
CUT TO:

 
EXT. LAURA PALMER'S HOUSE - MORNING
A quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood. Manicured lawns. A
PAPERBOY rides by on a bike, flings a paper onto the front
steps of the Palmer house.
CUT TO:
INT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING
SARAH PALMER, a thin, nervous chain-smoker, mid-forties,
turns some bacon over on the griddle, lights a cigarette and
goes to the bottom of the stairs.
SARAH
Laura, sweetheart, I'm not gonna
tell you again!
(silence; she waits)
Laura!
(no response; to
herself)
Oh for goodness sakes...
She starts up the stairs.
CUT TO:
INT. PALMER HALLWAY
Sarah opens the door to Laura's bedroom.
SARAH
(annoyed)
Laura, now means now-She stops short. Laura's bed has apparently been slept in
but there's no one in the room. Sarah walks down the hall to
the bathroom and knocks on the door.
SARAH
Laura?
No answer. She tries the door, opens it. No one inside. Sarah
goes back into the hall, starting to worry.

 
SARAH
(louder)
Laura! Honey, are you downstairs?
She goes into Laura's room. Notices for the first time that
the window is open and the lace curtains are blowing in the
breeze.
Sarah picks up the white princess phone beside Laura's bed,
dials and waits for someone to answer.
SARAH
(into the phone)
Bette, it's Sarah, listen, I just
came up to wake Laura and she's not
here, is she with Bobby?
INTERCUT:
INT. BRIGGS HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
BETTY BRIGGS, a healthy, solid woman, early forties, is on
the phone. Her husband, MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, a rock-hard
Air Force career man, sits at the table in background, ramrodstiff, drinking black coffee.
BETTY
(into the phone)
She might be, Sarah, but Bobby leaves
here about five to go running and
then goes on to football practice.
SARAH
Can you reach him? Can you find out?
I'll call the school-BETTY
I've got the number of the fieldhouse
here, let me get that for you--it's
474-SARAH
(writing it down)
Thanks, Bette-(a new idea)
(more)

 
SARAH (cont.)
You know, I'm wondering if she might
have gone out with Leland, he had an
early meeting-BETTY
I'm sure that's it, or she's with
Bobby-SARAH
Sure, let me call up to the hotel,
thanks.
She hangs up, then starts to dial another number.
CUT TO:
EXT. TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL FIELDHOUSE - MORNING
MAX HARTMAN, the genial, verbose football coach, picks up
the phone at the fieldhouse window. Football players are
practicing on the field in background.
HARTMAN
(into the phone)
Yeah, hello, this is the Coach...
yeah, Mrs. Palmer, no, Bobby didn't
show up for practice yet, matter of
fact, come to think of it, he's been
late every day this week, possibly
even last week and the week before,
although he might be here before you
know it--well, I could have him call
you Mrs. Palmer, is it urgent?...
okay, sure, fine.
CUT TO:
EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - MORNING
Re-establish.
CUT TO:

 
INT. GREAT NORTHERN PRIVATE DINING ROOM - MORNING
A group of fifteen NORWEGIAN BUSINESSMEN sit around an
executive dining table, talking animatedly in Norwegian while
consuming an immense, hearty breakfast.
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - MORNING
In an inner office, BENJAMIN HORNE, a roguish, charismatic
man, mid-forties looks in at the Norwegians, then consults
with his lawyer, LELAND PALMER, a handsome, refined man of
fifty, who takes a sheath of legal contracts from a briefcase
and shows them to Horne.
HORNE
(glancing at the
contracts)
Are they ready to sign?
LELAND
You don't want to mention to them
that we don't as yet have access to
the Packard land-HORNE
By the time we're ready to start
building we'll have that land, what
they don't know won't hurt them-(holds up a hand to
silence him)
--I have solid information that the
Packard Sawmill will go belly-up
within a year. We will buy it for a
song; one verse, no chorus.
(hands back the
contracts)
Let's go get these cheese-eaters
where they live.
As they move into the dining room, we MOVE to a LARGE MAP on
the wall, topographical of Twin Peaks and environs.
On the map, in a red-shaded area northeast of the Packard
Sawmill on Black Lake we see the words: "PROPOSED SITE FOR

 
GHOSTWOOD COUNTRY CLUB AND ESTATES"
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM - MORNING
Benjamin Home stands at the head of a table, addressing the
fifteen Norwegian businessmen. Beside him, an INTERPRETER
translates each sentence into Norwegian. Leland Palmer sits
at Horne's right hand.
HORNE
(in the middle of his
spiel)
...and great opportunities for growth
and expansion with a minimal capital
outlay... a clean and wholesome
environment much like your own...
with a quality of life to rival the
best our country can offer... of
course when I first spoke to Sven he
was naturally concerned about the
air here... if you'll permit me to
repeat what you told me after your
run this morning, Sven...
(pounds his chest
enthusiastically)
"My air sacs never felt so good!"
After the translation, the group all nod good-naturedly and
SVEN turns red. During which a HOTEL EMPLOYEE enters and
discreetly whispers something to Leland Palmer. Palmer nods
and rises.
LELAND
Excuse me a moment, gentleman.
(he stars out)
HORNE
So you see, here in Twin Peaks,
industry and health go hand in hand...
a harmonious and beneficial
coexistence...
Palmer exits.

INTERCUT:
INT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING
Sarah Palmer, on the phone in the kitchen, lighting another
cigarette with the butt of the one she's just finishing.
SARAH
Honey, it's Sarah, is Laura with
you?
LELAND
No, why?
SARAH
(slightly hysterical)
She didn't go with you this morning?
LELAND
No, what's wrong, what's this about?
SARAH
She's not here, she wasn't here this
morning-Looking out the window, Leland sees Sheriff Steadman drive
up, park and walk towards the hotel.
LELAND
She's probably with Bobby-SARAH
I can't find him--

 
LELAND
Well that's it then, let's not worry-SARAH
She would've left a note, why didn't
she tell me? Why didn't she leave me
a note?
LELAND
Sarah, calm down, darling, please...
Looking out towards the lobby he sees Steadman, speaking to
the DESK CLERK, who points in to where Leland is on the phone.
The Sheriff sees Leland, locks eyes with him and starts
walking towards him.
LELAND
(the first hint of
alarm, to himself)
Sheriff Steadman...
SARAH
(panicking)
Who? What did you say?
LELAND
(trying to cover)
Please. Sarah. I'm going to have to
call you back.
SARAH
(seeing it all, coming
unglued)
Oh my God... oh my God, Laura, no,
Laura!
LELAND
Sarah...
The Sheriff reaches Leland, hat in hand. Leland covers the
mouthpiece of the phone.
STEADMAN
Mr. Palmer...

 
LELAND
Is this about Laura?
STEADMAN
I'm afraid it is, sir.
We hear Sarah screaming for Leland over the phone.
CUT TO:
SARAH
SARAH
Leland, what is it? My baby! Tell
me, oh God, Leland!
CUT TO:
LELAND
Having heard the news, he goes back to the phone.
LELAND
(trembling, trying to
stay calm)
Sarah, I'm on my way home... please,
Sarah.
He hangs up. Picks up and struggling to remember the number,
unsteadily punches it in.
LELAND
Janice, this is Leland, oh God...
(he's momentarily
overcome, then)
...I want you to go next door and
stay with Sarah until I get there-please just do it.
He hangs up.
STEADMAN
Let me drive you, sir.
Palmer nods, points vaguely back towards the meeting room.

 
LELAND
I, uh, should tell Mr. Horne and
the...
STEADMAN
I'm sure they'll understand.
Benjamin Horne appears in the doorway.
HORNE
Leland, we're ready to go over the
contracts...
(sees him)
Leland?
LELAND
My daughter's dead.
CUT TO:
EXT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING
JANICE HOGAN, the Palmer's next door neighbor, exits the
front door of her house and runs next door to the Palmers'
house. She knocks on the door. We hear a heart-rending wail
of grief from inside.
JANICE
Sarah?!
She opens she door and rushes inside. Pause.

Another cry.

CUT TO:
INT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - MORNING
SHELLY JOHNSON, a young, slim waitress, is putting on her
coat, as the other waitress, HEIDI, a hefty German girl,
enters. The owner of the diner, NORMA JENNINGS, a statuesque,

 
well-preserved forty year old former beauty queen, pours a
warm-up for BOBBY BRIGGS, handsome, muscular high school
senior, wearing a letter jacket.
SHELLY
(popping gum)
What kept ya, Heidi? Seconds on
knockwurst this morning?
Heidi, a bubbly, easily embarrassed girl, giggles and blushes.
HEIDI
I couldn't get my car started.
SHELLY
Too busy jumpstartin' the old man.
BOBBY
Thought you Germans were always on
time.
NORMA
Bobby, I thought the only time you
cared about was makin' time.
Bobby and Shelly exchange a slightly guilty look. Bobby rises,
puts some change on the counter.
BOBBY
Hey, Shelly, you headin' out?
SHELLY
Headin' home.
BOBBY
I gotta go to practice, I could drop
you at your place on the way.
SHELLY
That'd be great, thanks.
BOBBY
(as they go, holds up
a quarter)
Here's a tune for you gals. Norma,
I'll see you in my dreams.

NORMA
Not if I see you first.
BOBBY
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
He drops the quarter in a jukebox, punches a song in. Bobby
and Shelly exit the diner as an aggressively cheerful German
Polka blares from the jukebox.
CUT TO:
EXT. DINER - MORNING
Bobby opens the door of his souped-up Buick Electra '88
convertible for Shelly.
BOBBY

hot to trot for you herself.
She gets in.
CUT TO:
INT. BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING
Bobby climbs in behind the wheel and starts the car. They
look around for a moment, make sure no one is watching them,

intimately)
BOBBY
All right.
He steps on it and peels out of the parking lot.

As they drive down the highway, a Sheriff's cruiser, lights
and siren blaring, approaches them, headed the other way.
CUT TO:
INT. BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING
Shelly and Bobby watch the cruiser as it zooms by them, then
look back. She takes a pull off a silver flask and knocks it
back. Bobby looks at her.
SHELLY
Hey, it's happy hour in France.
(offers it to Bobby)
Come on. Breakfast of champions.
BOBBY
Right. 'Little pick-me-up before
Home Room.
SHELLY
Thought I was your little pick-meup.
BOBBY
Baby, you're more like a three-stage
rocket. A pocket rocket.
SHELLY
What stage are we in now?

 
BOBBY
You sure your old man's still on the
road?
SHELLY
Called me last night from Tacoma.
Talked dirty to me for an hour. And
he ain't got a phone in his truck.

look)
Quit worryin' and start scurryin',

Hate to put you through this.

No. I have to see her. I want to see
what was done to my little girl.
Steadman leads him through the door.

Hey, man, you better get your butt

Who is?
ANOTHER KID
Sheriff is.
BOBBY
Well here I am in school.
MRS. JACKSON, the Principal's secretary, standing inside the

partition. She steps outside to speak to him.
MRS. JACKSON
Bobby, you're wanted in the
principal's office.
BOBBY
Who wants me in the principal's

Right now, young man.

A very smart and very pretty girl, DONNA HAYWARD, daughter
of Dr. Hayward, looks up and responds.
DONNA
Here.
Looking out the door window, Donna notices two State Troopers
walking up to the door.
HONEYCUTT
...Audrey Horne...

Botticelli-like beauty, with a halo of wavy black hair and
dark, haunted eyes, raises her hand.

eyes, in a black leather jacket, seated in the back corner,
his motorcycle boots up on the back of the chair in front of

Yo.

Honeycutt. The other Trooper remains standing outside the
door.
TROOPER #1
Excuse me, m'am, is Bobby Briggs in
this class?
HONEYCUTT
No, he's in 107 
TROOPER #1
Could I speak to you for a moment,
please?
HONEYCUTT
Certainly.
Honeycutt moves over to the Trooper. He speaks quietly to

 
her. The class watches closely.
A GIRL runs by outside the window, in the interior grass
courtyard, crying hysterically.
A buzz of curiosity builds through the classroom. Mrs.
Honeycutt turns and looks towards the seat next to Donna.
The one empty seat in the room.
Donna notices Honeycutt's look. Donna looks at her arms.
Covered with goosebumps. Without knowing why, her eyes tear
up. Donna turns to look at James. He's staring right at her,
sharing the same sudden fear.
The Second Trooper sticks his head back into the classroom.
TROOPER #2
We got him.
The First Trooper hurries out and they move off down the
hall towards the office. Honeycutt turns to the class, her
face a mask of unsettled emotions.
HONEYCUTT
(voice trembling)
There'll be an announcement from the
Principal's office...
She can't continue, her lip quivering violently. One more
word and she'll dissolve in tears. She goes to her desk and
sits and stares off into the comer.
DONNA
(silently, to herself)
Laura...
A pencil snaps in James' hand.

fifties.
BOBBY
(frightened)
--I told you, I got up early like I
always do, I went running like I
always do, I went to breakfast at
the Double "R" and I didn't go to
practice 'cause I didn't feel like
it.
BERNIE
Why didn't you feel like it, Bobby?
Were you upset about something?
ANDY
Something troubling you, Bobby? You
want to tell us about it?
BOBBY
Look, you guys, please, what'd I to?
What's goin' on?
The door opens. Sheriff Steadman enters. Red-eyed, Mrs.
Jackson, Wolchezk's secretary, leans in behind him to say...
MRS. JACKSON
Mr. Wolchezk, there's rumors all
over school. Maybe it'd be best if
they heard it from you.
Wolchezk nods. Steadman indicates to him "just a moment".
BOBBY
What is it? What's going on? Sheriff?
STEADMAN
Now, Bobby, look at me. Your
girlfriend, Laura Palmer's been
killed. She was found just after
dawn. She was with you last night
and you weren't where you were
supposed to be this morning. Have
these fellas advised you of your
rights?

 
BOBBY
Yes, but I didn't know why--Laura's
dead?
STEADMAN
Yes. Did you understand your rights
as they were explained to you?
BOBBY
Yeah, Jesus, you think I killed her?
STEADMAN
(firmly)
Bobby, we're gonna have you make a
phone call, you can call your folks
and they can arrange to get a lawyer
to be with you when we talk some
more--Andy, take Bobby out to make
his call-BOBBY
I loved her! And she loves me!
Pause. Andy takes Bobby by the arm. Bobby shakes him off.
BOBBY
You think 'cause I wasn't at football
practice that I killed my girlfriend?
You guys are nuts!
STEADMAN
(no more arguments)
Bobby... we're gonna talk about this
later. Mr. Wolchezk, why don't you
go ahead and make that announcement?
Andy leads Bobby out of the room. Wolchezk nods. Goes to the
public address system microphone behind his desk. Picks up
the microphone. Flips on the system. Collects himself.
WOLCHEZK
May I have your attention please...
may I have your attention... this is
Principal Wolchezk...
CUT TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MORNING
We slowly drift down the corridor away from the office. Bobby
is visible in the office, through the glass partitions, making
his phone call. The sound of the announcement fades in and
out, echoing through the empty halls as we pass different
class rooms.
WOLCHEZK'S VOICE
(over)
...I am deeply saddened to have to
tell you that early this morning
your classmate Laura Palmer was found
dead...
We hear shrieks and cries of grief from the various
classrooms.
WOLCHEZK'S VOICE
...this is a terrible moment for all
of us, for all of us who knew her,
her friends and family and it is
important that we all try to help
each other through this difficult
time... the police have asked me to
ask all of you, if you have any
information concerning Laura's
activities after school yesterday,
or yesterday evening to please come
forward... I am hereby suspending
all classes for the day but before
we leave I would like to ask all of
you to join me in observing a moment
of silence...
(his voice breaking)
...for Laura and her dear memory...
We come to rest on a trophy case in the hallway. Prominent
among the trophies is a large photo of Laura, wearing a crown
and gown, with Bobby in background, and bearing the caption:
HOMECOMING QUEEN, 1988, LAURA PALMER.
We stay on the photo throughout the moment of silence.

 
CUT TO:
DONNA HAYWARD
In her classroom, raising her head up after the moment of
silence, tears streaming down her face. Another GIRL puts
her arms around Donna's shoulders, comforting her. Tears and
cries of disbelief from throughout the classroom. Donna looks
back at...
CUT TO:
JAMES HURLEY
Wiping the tears from his eyes, covering up his total
emotional destruction.
CUT TO:
EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
Two sheriff's department cruisers and a state trooper's car
are parked outside. One of the Troopers we saw at the high
school is talking on his radio. a small group of NEIGHBORS
have gathered at a discreet distance, watching the house,
talking with quiet concern among themselves.
CUT TO:
INT. PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Sarah Palmer reclines on a Barca-lounger, a cold compress on
her forehead. His bag open beside him, Dr. Hayward has just
administered an injection to Sarah, discarding the syringe
and rolling her sleeve back down her arm. Janice brings Sarah
a glass of water.
Andy Brennan stands at the foot of the stairs. Sheriff
Steadman is seated on an ottoman next to Sarah, quietly
questioning her.
STEADMAN
What time was it when you last saw
Laura, Mrs. Palmer?

 
SARAH
(the sedative taking
effect)
What time? Uh, I suppose, let me
see... it would have been about nine
I think, yes, nine o'clock. She came
back from Bobby's and was going up
those stairs, those stairs right
there.
STEADMAN
Did she say anything?
SARAH
(dreamy)
No. She said goodnight. And I said,
"Goodnight, sweetheart" Then I heard
her door close.
She's close to tears for a moment, then it passes. Hayward
takes her hand and holds it. Sarah hears footsteps upstairs.
SARAH
Who's upstairs now?
STEADMAN
Your husband and one of my men.
SARAH
I can tell from the sounds that it
isn't her...
Steadman and Hayward exchange a look.
CUT TO:
INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY
Leland Palmer sits on the unmade bed, his hand absent-mindedly
brushing the bedspread. Deputy Bernie Hill is unobtrusively
searching the room. He opens a dresser drawer beside the bed
and discovers a locked diary, embosses with Laura's initials.
BERNIE
Do you know where the key for this
is, sir?

LELAND
(shakes his head)
Do you have to take that?
BERNIE
We'll return it as soon as possible.
Palmer nods. Bernie places the diary in a cardboard box along
with other collected evidence; her schoolbooks, letters,
etc.
Bernie moves to and opens the closet door. Turns on an
overhead light. The first thing he sees is a video camera
sitting on a shelf.
CUT TO:
INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - DAY
Steadman continues to gently question Sarah.
STEADMAN
Can you remember, Mrs. Palmer... did
she make or receive any phone calls?
SARAH
I heard her phone ring once.
STEADMAN
About what time was that?
SARAH
I don't know who it was...
The phone rings. Steadman looks at Andy, who goes into the
kitchen to answer it.
STEADMAN
Do you recall the time?
SARAH
I was combing my hair...
STEADMAN
You were getting ready for bed.

SARAH
Yes. Leland was just coming home...
She fades. Steadman realizes the interrogation is effectively
coming to an end. The doorbell rings. Janice moves to the
door, opens it and admits FATHER CLARENCE HUTCHINSON, a
rumpled, white-haired Episcopalian minister.
JANICE
Father...
FATHER CLARENCE
(nods, quietly)
How is she?
Janice takes his hat and coat.
JANICE
She's been asking for you.
Clarence moves into the living room Steadman rises.
FATHER CLARENCE
(nodding to the other
men)
Sarah?
Sarah looks up at him. Blinks. He takes her hand, sits beside
her.
SARAH
There's no more pain now, is there?
CLARENCE
(gently, soothing)
Our thoughts and prayers guide her
to her rest. And she is at peace,
Sarah. The peace of the just and the
good.
Sarah sits back, finding some comfort in his words. Returning
from the kitchen, Andy signals Steadman over to him.

 
ANDY
(quietly urgent)
That was Lucy. Got a call from a guy
works up at the mill, Janek Pulaski.
Says his daughter didn't come home
last night. And she didn't show up
at school today either.
Off Steadman's concern...
CUT TO:
INT. PACKARD SAWMILL - DAY
A State Trooper rapidly walks JANEK PULASKI, a barrel-shaped
mill worker, past the powerful, ripping saws towards the
exit. Pulaski's eyes are red from tears and stress.
CUT TO:
INT. SAWMILL CATWALK - DAY
On a catwalk outside the office, over the din of the mill,
Katherine Packard is confronting Giovanna Packard, as an
embarrassed Pete Martell stands by, near a large, control
console.
KATHERINE
You're not going anywhere and you're
not telling anybody anything!
GIOVANNA
(Italian accented,
slightly fractured
syntax)
Katherine, I am sorry if this offends
you, but I am the owner of this
sawmill-KATHERINE
And you don't know the first thing
about this sawmill, that's why I'm
running it--

 
GIOVANNA
I haven't exercised this authority
before but maybe I should have-KATHERINE
You're not shutting us down!
GIOVANNA
(with surprising
firmness)
No! I have the final say-so. Pete,
push the plug!
KATHERINE
Pete, don't you dare!
Pete considers for a moment, then pushes some large buttons
and throws some switches. Katherine storms off.

Thank you, may I have your
attention... this is "Jo" Packard...
INTERCUT:
THROUGHOUT THE MILL
The faces of the WORKERS are turned up towards the office
and the speakers.
GIOVANNA
This morning, as you know, the body
of Miss Laura Palmer was found near
our dock. Just now your friend and
co-worker Mr. Janek Pulaski has
learned that his daughter Sharon,
one of Laura's schoolmates, is missing
since last night... I suffered the
loss of someone dear to me not long
ago and when my husband, Andrew,
died the kind words and feelings
that you expressed to me helped me
so much. You are very kind people. I
have decided that today, in the lights
of what has happened, all work here
will stop, the Mill will shut down.
Perhaps you will spend the day with
your families and once again you can
all extend your good wishes to the
Pulaskis and to the Palmers.
(pause)
Thank you all for your attention.
Silence throughout the mill.
CUT TO:
KATHERINE
In a hallway, listening to Giovanna on one of the loud
speakers.

KATHERINE

Bitch!
She turns and sees startled MILL WORKER standing behind her,
hat in hand.
KATHERINE
What's you name?
WORKER
Fred Truax.
KATHERINE
You're fired!
She storms off.

EXT. HIGHWAY "21" - DAY
An empty road. Silence, suddenly broken by James Hurley, on
his motorcycle, cutting through the wind with reckless
abandon.
CUT TO:
EXT. ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - DAY
James drives the bike off the highway, into the station and
pulls up next to the pumps. Without a glance at the office,
he screws off the cap and starts filling the bike's gas tank.
ED HURLEY, James' uncle, a thin, taciturn man of forty, steps
out of the office and walks out to James as he tops off his
tank and hangs up the nozzle. Mindful of his state, Ed waits
for James to speak.
JAMES
Laura's dead.
ED
I heard.

 
With restrained emotion, Ed puts a hand on James' shoulder.
James inhales deeply, choking back his feelings. Looks at
his Uncle. Looks away.
JAMES
She was the one.
ED
(nods, waits)
Buy you a cup a coffee?
Pause.
JAMES
'Can't do it.
Before he's overcome with pain, James takes out a folded
note, hands it to Ed.
JAMES
If Donna comes by, would you give
this to her?
ED
You bet.
James hops on the bike, kicks it to life and roars off. Ed
watches him go. The door to the office opens and Ed's wife,
NADINE, a small, angry woman, wearing a black patch over her
left eye, calls out at him.
NADINE
Ed? They said those drapes'd be ready
by ten; now I want those drapes up
by nightfall.
Ed exhales heavily, waves at her without looking at her and
heads for his pick-up, parked nearby.

who's filling out a report.

Deputy Bernie Hill drives up in a cruiser, exits, carrying a
plastic evidence bag containing the clothes Sharon was
wearing. He takes them over to the dog's HANDLERS. The
Handlers open the bag and give the dog's the scent.
A number of Deputies and CIVILIAN VOLUNTEERS follow the dogs,
as they pick up the trail and strain at their leashes,
bounding up the hill into the woods.

"WELCOME TO TWIN PEAKS. POPULATION 51,201"
CUT TO:
INT. SEDAN - DAY
Behind the wheel is FBI field agent DALE COOPER, mid-thirties,
handsome in an unremarkable way. He activates and speaks
into a microphone attached to his lapel, connected to a small,
Walkman-sized tape recorder clipped to his belt.

COOPER
Diane, 2:15 in the afternoon, November
  Entering town of Twin Peaks.
Five miles south of the Canadian
border, twelve miles west of the
state line. Never seen so many trees
in my life. As W.C. Fields would
say, I'd rather be here than
Philadelphia. It's 54 degrees on a
beautiful sunny afternoon. Weatherman
said rain. If you could get paid
that kind of money for being wrong
60% of the time it'd beat working.
Mileage is 79,345, gauge is on
reserve, I'm riding on fumes, have
to tank up when I get into town,
remind me to tell you how much that
is. Lunch was $6.31 and I left her a
dollar tip, at the...
(digs out a restaurant
receipt)
...Lamplighter Inn, that's on Highway
2 near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna
fish sandwich on whole wheat and a
slice of cherry pie and coffee. Darn
good food. And if you ever get up
this way, Diane, that cherry pie is
worth a stop. Okay.
(looks for his notes)
I'll be looking for a...
(reads)
...Sheriff Daniel Steadman, he's
going to be at the Calhoun Memorial
Hospital with that girl they pulled
off the mountain. I'll be checking
into a motel after we're through
there. Sure the Sheriff'll be able
to recommend a clean place. Reasonably
priced.
Turns off the microphone. Turns it back on again.
COOPER
Forgot to mention. I stopped for
(more)

 
COOPER (cont.)
coffee and a pit stop about 10:30,
little diner near Bitteroot Lake.
Excellent coffee. Forgot to get the
receipt, can you believe it? That
was seventy five cents and I left a
quarter on the counter. Got to find
out what kind of trees these are.
They're really something.
Turns off the microphone. Whistles "Rhapsody in Blue."
CUT TO:
EXT. CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY
In long shot, we see Dale Cooper drive up, get out of the
car where he's greeted by Sheriff Steadman and together they
enter the hospital.
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Steadman and Cooper walk down the corridor.
STEADMAN
Sure glad to have you here. Kind'a
lucky, in a way, Sharon stepped out
across the state line. Whole town's
really badly shaken up-COOPER
Sure it is, nice, quiet place,
something like this. Let me stop you
right here in the hallway for second,
Sheriff.
(they stop; matter of
factly)
There a few things we ought to get
straight right off the bat. I've
learned this the hard way and it's
better to talk it out up front. When
the Bureau gets called in, the
Bureau's in charge. You're going to
(more)

 
COOPER (cont.)
be working for me and sometimes local
law enforcement has a problem with
that. Hope you understand.
STEADMAN
Like I said, we're glad to have you.
COOPER
And what kind of fantastic trees
have you got growing all around the
area? Big, majestic-STEADMAN
Ponderosa pine.
COOPER
(savors the sound)
"Ponderosa Pine."
(stars walking again)
Can somebody get me your coroner's
report on the dead girl while we're
in with the witness?
STEADMAN
'Haven't done the autopsy yet. We
can go downstairs to the morgue when
we're done here.
COOPER
Fine. What've we got from Sharon so
far?
STEADMAN
She hasn't said word one since we
found her.
They enter an office, past a stationed POLICEMAN. Janek and
his wife, MARIA PULASKI, and two of their other CHILDREN sit
on a bench by the door.
CUT TO:
INT. INTENSIVE CARE - DAY
Sharon Pulaski lies in bed, an IV in her arm, hooked up to

 
monitors, attended by two NURSES. Steadman and Cooper enter.
Seeing them, the attending physician, an attractive woman,
DR. SHELVY, moves towards them from the bed.
STEADMAN
Dr. Shelvy, this is FBI Agent Dale
Cooper.
SHELVY
Glad to know you.
COOPER
Doctor. How's the girl?
SHELVY
She's in shock. Suffering from
exposure.
COOPER
Was she raped?
SHELVY
Yes. More than once.
COOPER
One perpetrator?
SHELVY
Waiting for the tests.
COOPER
(to Steadman)
Any connection to the murdered girl?
STEADMAN
Same high school. Far as we know
they hardly knew each other.
(shrugs)
No connection.
COOPER
Can I question her?
SHELVY
This girl doesn't even know where
she is. Or if she is.

COOPER
What are you saying?
SHELVY
We need a CAT scan and we aren't
equipped for that. My opinion is
there may be neurological damage.
She's just not responsive at all.
COOPER
I'd like to look at her fingers.
Shelvy and Steadman look at each other.
SHELVY
All right.
Cooper moves to Sharon. Her eyes are open, looking up at the
ceiling, moving restlessly. Cooper picks up left hand, looks
closely at the wrists, sees the distinctive wounds and a
look of intense interest comes over him. He immediately looks
very closely at her fingernails.
STEADMAN
We already scraped for particles.
COOPER
That's not what I'm looking for.
(looks closely, almost
to himself)
Nothing here... not a thing...
SHARON
(a sort of drugged,
horrified whine)
Don't go there...
SHELVY
(moving quickly to
her side)
Sharon?
COOPER
Sharon?

 
Sharon almost seems to focus on them for a moment. A single
tear runs from her eye.
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
We see the floor indicator numbers light up, going down as
the elevator descends. Steadman and Cooper ride down, along
with a ONE-ARMED MAN. The door opens on the first floor. We
notice a MAN talking to a NURSE, seated behind a desk, eating
her lunch off a cafeteria tray. She laughs uneasily at
something the Man says. The One-Armed Man exits. The elevator
doors close.
The elevator descends to the basement. The doors open.
Steadman and Cooper exit.
CUT TO:
INT. MORGUE EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
Bright overhead lights pop on, momentarily blinding us. A
low, vibratory throb of humming machinery. Steadman and Cooper
and a MORGUE ATTENDANT walk to a stainless steel examination
table in the middle of the white-tiled room.
Laura Palmer's body lies on the table, covered by a shroud
of cloudy plastic. Cooper takes her left arm out from under
the cover and examines her fingers.
STEADMAN
We did scrape the nails when she
came in.
COOPER
(sees something under
the nail of her ring
finger; energized)
There it is. Here it is. Oh my God,
there it is.
STEADMAN
What?

 
COOPER
(to the Morgue
Attendant)
Leave us alone please.
The Attendant looks at Steadman. He nods. The Attendant exits.
COOPER
(pointing to her nail)
Sheriff, I need something to grab
onto this.
Steadman uncovers and rummages through an autopsy tool tray,
finds and hands Cooper a pair of fine tweezers. Cooper
separates the nail from the finger, works the tweezers in
and dislodges a small, white speck from under the nail onto
a stainless steel tray.
Cooper turns on his microphone, swings a mounted magnifying
glass over the tray, pulls it down over the speck and turns
on its attached light.
COOPER
3:27 PM. Diane, Twin Peaks County
Morgue. With the body of the victim...
what's her name?
STEADMAN
Laura Palmer.
COOPER
Laura Palmer. Got here before the
autopsy. It's the same thing, Diane,
told you I had a feeling we'd see
this again
STEADMAN
What've you got there?
COOPER
Ring finger. Under the nail. Let's
see what he left us.
CUT TO:

 
THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS
Using the tweezers, Cooper turns over the speck and we see
printed on the tiny piece of white paper is the letter "R" .
COOPER
It's an "r". Diane, let's give this
to Albert and his team, don't go to
Sam, Albert seems to have a little
more on the ball.
RESUME SCENE
As Cooper turns off the mic and turns to Steadman.
COOPER
Need to bag and tag this.
STEADMAN
You gonna let me in on whatever the
hell's going on here?
COOPER
Sheriff, we've got a lot to talk
about.

CUT TO:
THE BED OF THE PICK-UP
Inside is a large, wrapped package with a label that reads,
"GENTLE JIM'S DRAPES." Ed turns from the truck bed, as he
sees Donna get out of her car and approach him.
DONNA
Hi, Ed.
ED
Hey, Donna.
He sees she's about to burst into tears, opens his arms and
embraces her. She weeps.
ED
I'm so sorry...
She nods, starts to regain her composure.
DONNA
Have you seen James?
ED
He came by.
DONNA
Is he okay?
ED
No.
DONNA
You know where he went? He wasn't up
at "Hemingway's."
ED
I don't know. But he said to to give
this to you.
He hands her a folded note. Donna opens it. It reads:
"21 BILLIARDS. SEE JOEY AFTER NINE."

 
Out on the highway, a white 1959 Chevy Impala slams on its
brakes, hits the horn, the driver does a squealing U-turn to
pull into the gas station parking lot and stops near Donna
and Ed. Mike Nelson, Bobby's friend, is driving the car. He
leans out the window.
MIKE
(furious; to Donna)
Hey! What the hell are you doin'
here?
DONNA
I-MIKE
We've been lookin' all over for you!
In case you didn't know it, Bobby's
in a lot of trouble! He's my best
friend, you're supposed to be with
me and we're goin' down to the police
station to be with him!
DONNA
Don't tell me where I ought'a be-and by the way, Laura was my best
friend-MIKE
Get in the car!
ED
(he's heard enough)
Muffle it there, Junior.
MIKE
Mind your own business!
ED
You're on my lot, friend.
MIKE
Not for long! Donna, you get to the
Sheriff's right now!
Mike guns it and digs out in the loose gravel, fishtailing
onto the highway. Donna's trembling with anger and

 
frustration.
DONNA
Boy, do I know how to pick 'em.
Nadine throws open a window in their apartment above the
garage and calls out.
NADINE
Ed! You waitin' for those drapes to
hang themselves?!
ED
(waves dismissively
at her; to Donna)
I know how to pick 'em too.
They both manage a small smile. Donna heads for her car.
DONNA
If you see James, tell him I'm looking
for him.
ED
You bet. Take it easy now, Donna.

CUT TO:
INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY
Steadman and Dale Cooper are seated at a table, examining
the box of evidence that was taken from Laura Palmer's
bedroom. Steadman takes a video cassette out of the box.
COOPER
That's the tape you found in the
video camera in Laura's room.
STEADMAN
Right.

COOPER
At a certain point I'm going to want
to show that to the boyfriend.
STEADMAN
You say when.
Cooper puts on a pair of thin, rubber gloves and looks into
the box of Laura's belongings.
COOPER
Did you complete all your forensics?
STEADMAN
Yes.
Cooper picks up Laura's locked diary.
COOPER
No key yet, huh?
STEADMAN
Still looking.
Cooper casually snaps open the lock, opens the diary and
uses an orange stick to turn to the last entries. He activates
his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, I've just opened Laura Palmer's
diary. This is the last entry, dated
yesterday, November  ..
(reads)
"Cloudy. Sort of giddy. Not even
cautiously optimistic. Day Eighteen.
Eight o'clock. Asparagus for dinner
again. I hate asparagus. Does this
mean I'll never grow up"... then
she's written...
(counts)
...nine questions marks... "Nervous
about meeting 'J' tonight." That's
the last entry.
(to Steadman)
(more)

 
COOPER (cont.)
That's something to get started on.
STEADMAN
(writing down the
letter "J")
One out of twenty-six.
Cooper turns back a few pages and reads again.
COOPER
Day fourteen. Indian summer. Picnic
at Le Sparkwood Cafe--al fresco. Am
I this happy?"
INTERCUT:
THE DIARY
As Cooper continues to thumb back through the pages, he finds
a small key inside a small, slit glassine envelope, taped to
a page.
COOPER
(instant recognition)
Diane. I just turned back eighteen
days; it says here, "Day One." What
we've got taped to the page here is
a glassine envelope containing a
white residue and what looks to be a
key to a...
(thinks, places it)
...safety deposit box.
(closely examines
envelope)
Sheriff, after you very carefully
remove this key, we're going to run
this envelope and my bet is it'll
test positive for cocaine.
STEADMAN
(indignantly)
That's impossible-COOPER
You ever been surprised before?

STEADMAN
Mr. Cooper, you didn't know Laura
Palmer-COOPER
Benefit of the doubt, innocent until
proven guilty, but that's still
cocaine in that envelope.
Holds out the envelope. Steadman takes it.
COOPER
Get started on a court order to open
her deposit box and maybe we'll both
find out a few things about Laura
Palmer.
Steadman exits. Cooper reaches into the box again.
COOPER
Diane, I'm holding in my hand a box
of small, chocolate bunnies...
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY
A despondent Bobby Briggs sits at a table with his parents,
Bette and Major Briggs. Across from them is Bobby's lawyer,
a short, rotund, silver-throated man by the name of GILMAN
WHITE. A DEPUTY enters to announce...
DEPUTY
We're ready for you.
He waits to escort them out.
GILMAN
(instructing Bobby)
Now Bobby, remember what I told you;
the Federal Bureau of Investigation
does not appreciate smart talk. You
answer their questions, openly and
honesty. If you're having any trouble,
(more)

 
GILMAN (cont.)
any strange feelings, any questions,
you consult with me, that's why I'm
here. If there are any questions I
would prefer that you not answer
directly, I will so signal you. Is
that understood?
Bobby nods sullenly.
MAJOR BRIGGS
What do you say to Mr. White, Robert?
BOBBY
Yes, sir.
The Deputy moves to Bobby. Bobby rises and walks out with
him. White picks up his briefcase and follows.
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Steadman and Cooper enter and take seats across the table
from Bobby and Gilman White. There is a TV and VCR on a stand
in the corner.
COOPER
(right to the point)
Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?
BOBBY
No!
COOPER
(writes something on
a piece of paper)
She was studying at your house until
about nine thirty last night, isn't
that right?
BOBBY
Yeah.
(looks at Gilman)
Yes, sir.

 
Cooper shows Steadman the piece of paper: on it he's written,
"He didn't do it." Steadman is nonplusses.
COOPER
She drive herself home?
BOBBY
Yes.
COOPER
You had a big fight with her last
week, didn't you?
BOBBY
So what?
Gilman puts a hand on Bobby's arm.
BOBBY
If I had a fight with her, if I sang
songs with her, if I went skipping
rope with her what difference does
it make? I didn't kill her.
COOPER
Bobby, here's how this works, we ask
questions and you answer only the
questions that we ask. Briefly and
to the point.
Cooper picks up a remote control and turns on the VCR in the
corner. A picture appears on the monitor.
INTERCUT:
THE MONITOR
A slightly fuzzy picture: Donna and Laura in a sunlit forest
glade, having a Indian summer picnic on a red and white
checked blanket, blanket and mugging for the handheld video
camera. We don't see or hear the camera operator.
COOPER
(watching Bobby
carefully)
Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

A cold, jealous rage rises in Bobby as he watches the girls
laughing, seeing only Laura and her happiness.
BOBBY
No.
COOPER
If you didn't take them, who did?
Did you know that Laura was seeing
someone else?
(no answer)
That's what you fought about last
week, isn't it, Bobby? Look at these
pictures, look how happy she is.
(no answer)
'You ever take cocaine with Laura?
BOBBY
(shocked)
I never did that!
GILMAN
Excuse me but what are you charging
my client with?
COOPER
(smiles, as he writes
again)
That's right, you're a football
player, aren't you, Bobby?
He shows Steadman the pad; on it he's written: "Kid's a lousy
liar."
COOPER
If you knew who she was seeing, trust
me on this, now's the time to tell
us.
BOBBY
Why don't you ask Donna? She was
there with 'em!

 
COOPER
I'm asking you, Bobby. Give me a
name. Here's a clue. First initial
"J."
Bobby can't, or won't, come up with a name.
BOBBY
(almost to himself)
"J"...
(self-pitying)
She wouldn't. She wouldn't'a done
that to me.
(almost mumbling)
I can't believe it. I can't believe
it...
COOPER
(as he rises)
You didn't love her anyway.
(to Steadman)
Let him go.
Cooper exits. Steadman tries to give the appearance of keeping
up.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Cooper exits the interrogation room. He looks towards the
desk and sees Donna speaking to Lucy, the dispatcher. Mike
is standing sullenly nearby. Cooper makes a bee-line for
Donna.
COOPER
Donna?
(she looks up at him)
You and I are going to have a little
talk about a picnic.
Donna looks at Cooper, then at Mike.
CUT TO:

 
EXT. MOUNTAIN SIDE FOREST - DAY
A TRACKER is holding back two of his dogs, who are barking
furiously at the mouth of a hillside cave. A Trooper stands
by with his gun drawn.
Deeply shaken, Deputy Andy Brennan exits the cave a moment
later, holding a flashlight and his gun. He absent-mindedly
walks past the others and they watch him drift into the woods.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
Andy slumps down onto a rock. Sets down his pistol and takes
out his handi-talk radio and, with difficulty, activates it.
His gun slides off the rock into the dirt.
ANDY
(shaking)
Lucy... Lucy...
INTERCUT:
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE SWITCHBOARD - DAY
Lucy, at the switchboard, speaks over her headset.
LUCY
Andy, is that you?... I can hardly
hear you...
ANDY
Tell Dan, we found where... it
happened... Ghostwood Forest, about
three miles east of the highway...
tell Dan...
(he can't continue)
LUCY
(quietly, tenderly)
Andy, are you okay? Sweetie?
ANDY
I didn't cry... but Lucy... it's
horrible... oh, God...

He can't fight it. He starts to cry.
FADE TO BLACK:
END ACT THREE

Steadman backs his four-wheel vehicle up to the back door,
throws open the rear gate and goes into an open equipment
room.

Cooper guides Donna into the interrogation room and closes
the door. Cooper studies her.
COOPER
Have a seat, Donna.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Bobby's parents and Gilman White are talking near the exit,
as Bobby is released by a Deputy from the holding cell area.
Bobby looks at his parents, then sees Mike waiting by a water
cooler near the front desk, where Lucy is typing. Bobby walks
over to Mike.
MIKE
Hey, buddy.
BOBBY
Hey, Snake, we're outta here.
MIKE
Just a sec', Donna's in there.
BOBBY
(low and angry)
You straightened her out yet?
MIKE
I don't know what's up with her,
man.

BOBBY
Forget her. I got it figured. Laura
and her. We're lookin' at some
freakin' biker. And some freakin'
biker is gonna get his head busted
open.
MIKE
Who is it?
Lucy pauses in her typing and slightly turns her head towards
them. Bobby picks up on it.
BOBBY
Come out here.
They head for the exit, passing his parents and lawyer.
MAJOR BRIGGS
(formal but sympathetic)
Robert, I'll be at home this evening
if you need a sympathetic ear.
BOBBY
I don't need any damn sympathetic
anything.
Bobby and Mike leave the building.
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Cooper and Donna, his questioning in progress.
COOPER
You mean to tell me you and Laura
went on this picnic alone, just the
two of you?
DONNA
What's wrong with that?

 
COOPER
Deep into the woods, not another
soul around-DONNA
Is there some law against having a
picnic?
COOPER
Donna, this is interesting to me,
because with just the two of you out
there-He turns on the VCR with the remote and we see the video of
the picnic.
COOPER
I can't for the life of me figure
out how these pictures got taken.
Donna, feeling trapped and frightened, thinks fast.
DONNA
Oh. Oh, that. That's easy. There was
a hiker, came along with a backpack
and we asked her to take the pictures.
COOPER
What was her name?
DONNA
I don't think we ever asked her. Or
I forget. Maybe we did, I don't
remember.
COOPER
(non-threatening)
Donna... who are you protecting?
DONNA
Nobody. That's what really happened.
COOPER
Does the person's name start with
the letter "J"?

 
DONNA
(blushing)
I told you, she didn't tell us her
name.
COOPER
Donna, this is serious business.
More serious than a girl falling in
love with someone other than her
boyfriend. Much more serious than
you know.
Donna remains silent. We hear a beep, an intercom on the
desk activating.
LUCY'S VOICE
Agent Cooper, the Sheriff's ready to
roll up to the site and I've got
something else for you here.
COOPER
(into the speaker)
You can come on in.
(to Donna)
I know Laura was your best friend.
You've been through a lot today.
We're finished here--for the time
being.
Donna rises. She exits. Steadman and Lucy enter.
STEADMAN
Tell Agent Cooper what you heard
Lucy.
LUCY
Okay. Now, after you were done with
Bobby? And he was taken back to his
cell? Well, then his parents were
standing by the door, with his lawyer,
and Bobby, he was released and he
came out and he saw his friend Mike,
who was down by the water cooler,
which is near my desk--

 
COOPER
Uh-huh, uh-huh-LUCY
Okay, okay. Well, I pretended to be
typing but I was typing what Mike
and Bobby were saying, well they
didn't say exactly who it was that
they were talking about but anyway
here's what they were saying-She offers him a typed page. He doesn't take it
COOPER
They said the guy we're looking for
is a biker.
LUCY
(crestfallen)
Yeah...
STEADMAN
(amazed again)
Yeah.
Cooper turns on the VCR with the remote, fast forwards the
picture, then lets it run at normal speed until Donna moves
up extremely close to the lens. He freezes the frame and
points to a partial reflection of a motorcycle in the pupil
of her eye.
CUT TO:
EXT. MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK - DAY
A motorcycle is parked on a high crest, overlooking a wooded
valley and the town in the deep background. We hear the sound
of SIRENS wailing in the distance.
James Hurley sits on a rock. His eyes red, his face torn
with grief. He holds a small envelope in one hand. His other
hand holds something protectively in a closed fist.
CUT TO:

 
HIS HAND
As it opens and we see he's holding a gold necklace in the
shape of half of a heart. He rubs it lovingly and closes his
hand again.
INT. MOUNTAINSIDE CAVE - DAY
In the darkness, we see a powerful beam of light sweep slowly
across the walls, revealing random patterns of spayed blood.
The light follows the trail of the blood across a dirt floor
and up a raised mound of blood-saturated dirt.
On top of the mound is the other half of the heart-shaped
gold necklace and just below it a folded piece of paper.
Something is written on the paper in what could be blood.
We see it is Dale Cooper holding the flashlight. Behind him
are Steadman and some other officers. Cooper reaches in with
a gloved hand, gently turns over the note and reads...
FIRE. WALK WITH ME.
CUT TO:
A TV SET
On the monitor is a news report showing location video footage
of Cooper, Steadman and the other officers emerging from the
mountainside cave.
LOCAL REPORTER
(voice-over)
...from what is believed to be where
the brutal slaying of Laura Palmer
occurred. And tonight, Sharon
Pulaski...
We see a high-school yearbook picture of Sharon.
LOCAL REPORTER
...the second intended victim, who
apparently escaped her captor and
fled to safety, remains hospitalized
in critical condition at Calhoun
Memorial...

During above we pull back to discover we're in a cheaply
panelled and furnished living room.
CUT TO:
SHELLY SIMPSON
The Double "R" Diner waitress, wearing a bathrobe and smoking
a cigarette, is watching the set in her living room. She
flicks her cigarette into the ashtray, unable to take her
eyes off the set.
Her husband, LEO JOHNSON, a lanky, sinewy, pallid man of
thirty, pomaded hair, wearing a torn t-shirt, dirty jeans
and white socks, his heavy boots nearby on the floor. He
holds an open bottle of creme de menthe.
SHELLY
Lord, I can't believe it. I can't
believe it.
Leo has not taken his eyes off the ashtray.
CUT TO:
LEO'S POV - THE ASHTRAY
Filled with butts. Two different brands.
CUT TO:
RESUME SCENE
Leo continued to look at the ashtray.
LEO
(politely)
Shelly... turn off the TV.
SHELLY
Why? Why? I went to see this-She turns to him. Sees the look on his face. Gets up
immediately and turns off the television.

LEO
Shelly, sit down here a minute and
help me out.
She sits obediently. He still hasn't looked at her.
LEO
What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?
SHELLY
Whatever's around.
LEO
No, you don't.
(he picks up a butt
from the ashtray)
You smoke these.
(he picks up a
different brand butt)
What are these doing here?
SHELLY
Come on, Leo, I get different packs
at the diner. Me and Norma.
Pause.
LEO
There's two things, Shelly. First,
this house should be cleaned up for
me when I come home... I mean clean.
SHELLY
Okay-He holds up a hand and silences her instantly.
LEO
(evenly)
Number two. You smoke one brand of
cigarettes from now on. Because if I
ever see two different brands of
cigarettes in any ashtray in this
house again, I'm gonna snap your
neck like a twig.

Trembling, he takes a big swig of creme de menthe and locks
eyes with her.
SHELLY
You got nothing to worry about with
me, darlin'.
She forces a smile. He looks at her hard. Right through her.

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
On a small TV monitor at the front desk, continuing the report
on the news about Laura. Watching are the DESK CLERK and the
group of Norwegians we saw earlier in the day, who are in
the process of checking out of the hotel. Two BELLMEN are
loading their baggage on a trolley.
LOCAL REPORTER'S VOICE
(voice over, on the
TV)
...cheerleader, Homecoming Queen,
most popular girl in school, friend
to many in the community. Seventeen
years old. Laura Palmer, found dead
this morning, the victim of violent
crime...
During above, we see Benjamin Horne, the Translator, and
Sven Jorgenson, the group's leader, are standing beside a
nearby column, speaking in hushed, urgent tones.
HORNE
--Mr. Jorgenson, I urge you to
reconsider, I want to appeal to your
best nature-The Translator tries to translate simultaneously and then

 
struggles to keep up with them both.
SVEN
(over the translator)
Best nature? We have best nature at
home; no violent crime, crime rate
nothing-HORNE
It is a great injustice to judge our
community by this horrible exception
to the rule, I have a daughter myself,
she's the same age, she goes to the
same high school-SVEN
Everyone here have gun! Not good!
HORNE
Sir, you are throwing away the
investment opportunity of a lifetime-SVEN
Better that then to throw lifetime
away-HORNE

You keep out of this!

INT. JOHNNY HORNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
Johnny throws himself down to a sprawling position on the

SYLVIA HORNE, Johnny's mother, Benjamin's wife, and Audrey
Horne, her daughter, sit at the dining room table, having
tea from a sterling tea service. Strained silence. Audrey
stares at the heel of her black leather pump. Sylvia hears
approaching footsteps and presses a hand to her forehead in
exasperation. A NURSE enters the room.
NURSE
Mrs. Horne, I think it might help if
you'd talk to Johnny yourself-SYLVIA
(pained sarcasm)
Oh, you think it might help? You
tell Johnny, one more time, that
Laura is not coming to work with him
this afternoon, tomorrow afternoon
or any afternoon. What is so difficult
to understand about that?
CUT TO:
INT. ED HURLEY'S GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON
A small television on a work bench is on, continuing the

CUT TO:
INT. BANK - DAY
Cooper and Steadman are being lead into a back room by ALICE
BRADY, a uniformed bank guard. During below, she retrieves
Laura's safety deposit box.
ALICE
(slightly hysterical)
I knew Laura she was always so nice-COOPER
When was the last time she came in?
ALICE
Oh, I couldn't tell you exactly,
there are so many boxes here-COOPER
You don't keep records.
ALICE
Well we have plenty of paper work as
it is, you know, with a town this
size-COOPER
Can you tell me how long Laura has
had the box?
ALICE
I'd say about six months, I could
check for you-COOPER
Would you please? And you can just
give me the box, m'am, we'll take it
from here.
Cooper takes the box. He and Steadman enter a smaller, privacy
room. Cooper sets the box down and opens it with the key he

 
found in Laura's diary. He reaches inside and lifts out the
sole item in the box.
A magazine entitled: "SEX TOYS: SWINGERS, COAST-TO-COAST."
STEADMAN
Jesus...
Just touching the edge of the pages, Cooper leafs through
the magazine. A thick, rubber-band wrapped packet of one
hundred dollar bills fall out.
COOPER
Over ten grand. That's a lotta Girl
Scout cookies.
Cooper turns the magazine to a dog-eared page.
INTERCUT:
THE MAGAZINE
Featuring ads and photographs of men and women, soliciting
various sexually-oriented responses. One of the ads is
circled. It is a burn-out, flashbulb photo of Sharon Pulaski,
in sex lingerie, a drugged glaze in her eyes.
COOPER
There's your connection.
CUT TO:
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EARLY EVENING
Cooper and Steadman walk through the town square, past the
gazebo, towards city hall.
COOPER
(stopping to look at
the gazebo)
I've seen these in pictures before,
but there is an actual gazebo, right
here in your city square. That is
beautiful.

 
STEADMAN
(looks at his watch)
You know we're gonna be late for
that meeting-COOPER
(continuing on)
You know, I'm from Philadelphia and
a thing like this, a gazebo, in a
town square that is so meticulously
maintained.
(head snaps around,
noticing another
detail)
--look how these hedges are clipped.
They head towards a side entrance in city hall. We MOVE to
PICK UP a group of REPORTERS, milling around between a few
television news crew trucks in front of city hall and STAY
WITH one REPORTER, taping a stand-up news report in front of
the hall's imposing mahogany doors.
REPORTER
--I'm speaking to you tonight from
in front of the Town Hall of Twin
Peaks, where, just behind me, the
City Council and Chamber of Commerce
have called an emergency session to
discuss the tragic events that have
rocked this remote, peaceful
community. How will the community
react? We'll be here to bring that
news to you as soon as it's available
to us.
CUT TO:
INT. TOWN HALL AUDITORIUM - DAY
On a raised dais, Dale Cooper watches the City Council and
Chamber of Commerce MEMBERS moving down the aisles, milling
about, taking their seats. Prominent among them is Benjamin
Horne. Seated near him are Katherine and Pete Martell.
Cooper's eye catches Giovanna Packard as she enters. He almost
does a double take. He leans over to Sheriff Steadman and
asks discreetly...

COOPER
Who's the babe?
STEADMAN
That's Mrs. Packard
COOPER
Packard Sawmill?
(Steadman nods)
Where's Mr. Packard?
STEADMAN
Died in a boating accident last year.
Andrew Packard practically built
this town. Brought her back from
Italy four years ago. Left her
everything. Which didn't exactly
please Packard's sister.
(points to Katherine)
...that's her over there. The original
deep freeze.
COOPER
(meaning Giovanna)
So rich and available. Bet there's a
line outside her door.
Benjamin Horne crosses to Giovanna, with a greeting of
unctuous sympathy.
STEADMAN
My advice is, take a number.
COOPER
I'm not big on crowds.
(seeing Horne)
Who's the glad-handing dandy?
STEADMAN
Benjamin Horne. Local big-wig. Owns
half the town. He's not after her,
he's after her land.
At the podium, with some considerable effort, DWAYNE MILFORD,
the frail, eighty-six year old Mayor of Twin Peaks, nearing

 
the end of his 23rd consecutive term, gavels the meeting to
order and speaks into the microphone.
MILFORD
(shaking, nearly deaf)
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could
have your attention...
(smacks the microphone)
...is this thing on?! Is this thing
on?!
Steadman steps in beside Milford, pats him encouragingly on
the back and adjusts the microphone so Milford can speak
into it more directly.
MILFORD
We have all today shared in the
grief... the grief that flies to
death. The tragic death of young
Miss Palmer, so beautiful, so
innocent. And this grief is attended
by fear. Tonight it preoccupies us.
And to help us assuage our fears, I
give you Sheriff Steadman.
He yields to Steadman, who first helps Milford to his seat.
STEADMAN
Folks, I'll get right to the point.
Laura Palmer was brutally murdered.
It looks like Sharon Pulaski barely
escaped the same fate. When Sharon
turned up across the state line,
this became a matter for the FBI.
And after hearing what Agent Dale
Cooper had to tell me, I, for one,
am grateful for his and the Bureau's
help. I think you'll feel the same
way. Agent Cooper?
He yields the microphone to Dale Cooper.
COOPER
Ladies and Gentlemen, Federal Bureau
of Investigation, Special Agent Dale
(more)

 
COOPER (cont.)
Cooper. Kidnapping. Rape. Murder.
These are words you're fortunate
enough not to hear very often in
your town. I wish I could tell you
that you won't hear them again. But
these are the facts; one year ago,
almost to the day, in a town in the
southwest corner of this state, the
body of a girl named Teresa Banks
was found. She had no family, no one
came forward to claim her body. It
was hardly even news. Until today.
(a stir runs through
the room)
There are irrefutable similarities
that for obvious reasons I will not
specify, that lead us to conclude
that Laura Palmer is the second, and
Sharon Pulaski would have been the
third victim, of the same killer.
(the room is abuzz)
There is a chance that the person
who committed these crimes is someone
from this town, possibly even someone
you know. You are the leaders of
this community. It's vitally important
that this not turn into a witch hunt.
I would like to propose that you
enact some specific measures to
protect the innocent and bring the
guilty to justice...
He consults his notes.
COOPER
I would propose a public service
announcement over local media asking
for any information regarding these
crimes, with a hotline number, manned
by volunteers or community-funded
operators, to field and sort through
these calls... an investigation like
this can turn on the most seemingly
insignificant piece of information.
(more)

 
COOPER (cont.)
I would also strongly suggest that
you impose a temporary curfew for
those under eighteen years of age.
Keeping your kids off the streets
now will teach them a degree of
caution that may protect them in the
days and weeks to come. I will remind
you that these crimes occurred at
night.

The poor dear... poor Sarah...
HAYWARD
Eileen, the brutality... the madness
of it...
EILEEN
I know...
(reaches for his hand)
HAYWARD
They're not releasing many details.
Wisely, I think. At the scene, where
it happened... no one else knows
this... they found part of a necklace,
Laura's necklace. Half of a golden
heart. She was wearing it in a video
they found... I'm telling you this
for a reason; Donna was in that video
with her... they don't know who shot
the video or who else was with them...
but they think the killer may have
the other half of that heart...
Alarmed, Donna starts to slowly creep back up the stairs,

Now listen to me, squirt, this is

HARRIET
Well, this is serious too.
DONNA
Shhhhh... I'm going out the window
in a few minutes and you're going to
cover for me-HARRIET
Aren't you aware that there's a
curfew? They just announced it on
the radio-DONNA
I know there's a curfew, Einstein,
that's why I need you to cover for
me.
HARRIET
I suppose this'll include a phone
conversation with Mike, Mr. Bonehead
Boyfriend.
DONNA
This is about Laura. And it's really
serious.
HARRIET
Check.
They squeeze each other's hands with strong and pure sisterly
affection. Donna puts on her jacket, slides open the window.

DONNA
I'm gonna need to borrow your bike.
HARRIET
Oh, well then put a little air in
the back tire.
DONNA
Don't forget to brush your teeth.
Donna steps out into the branches of a large oak tree.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Donna drops silently to the ground from the oak tree and
creeps around the house, out of sight of the windows. She
ducks alongside a hedge edging the yard and into an alley
behind the house.
Donna takes Harriet's bike, leaning against the side of the
garage, climbs on the bike and pedals down the deserted alley.
CUT TO:
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
Donna rides silently through the quiet streets and turns
onto the Highway 21 service road.
CUT TO:
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
Mike Nelson and Bobby Briggs are loitering by the magazine
rack, slightly beered-up. They're waiting for a CUSTOMER at
the register to exit. He finally does. The CASHIER says to
Mike and Bobby...
CASHIER
Okay, bring it here. Make it fast.
Mike quickly lugs a case of beer to the counter. Bobby throws
down some bills. The Cashier rings up the sale.

BOBBY
(a strange smile)
Fuel for the party animal.
CASHIER
You guys better stay off the streets
with that; there's a curfew tonight.
Bobby picks up the case and they quickly exit.
CUT TO:
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
They climb into Bobby's convertible. Both crack open a cool
one and chug it as Bobby revs up the engine.
BOBBY
That biker? That "J" must be for
James... James Hurley.
MIKE
What're we gonna do about it?
BOBBY
They weren't at "Hemingway's",
bastards are hidin' out!
MIKE
There's always some of those eggheads
hangin' out at the Roadhouse.
BOBBY
We're gonna go down there...
MIKE
No, first we're gonna get Donna and
get some answers.
BOBBY
Let's boogie.
They speed off.
CUT TO:

EXT. POOL HALL - NIGHT
Donna rides up and leans her bike against the side of a crude,
one-story cinderblock building with a sign that reads: "21"
BILLIARDS: RACK 'EM UP." Donna enters.
CUT TO:
INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT
Five tables under low lights, two being used. Rough PATRONS
sit at small formica tables, drinking beer and watching the
players. All eyes hook onto Donna, the only woman in the
joint.
CUT TO:
INT. BOBBY'S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT
Bobby and Mike cruise down the street. They both finish their
beers and toss the cans into the road. They pull up and park
in front of Donna's house. Mike hops over the door and starts
towards the door.
BOBBY
Don't take any more crap from that
pretty bitch.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
Mike reaches the door and rings the doorbell.
CUT TO:
INT. DONNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Harriet hears the doorbell, goes to the window, looks out
and sees Mike standing at the door and Bobby in the car at
the curb. She droops down on the bed.
HARRIET
(to herself)
The best laid plans of mice and men.

CUT TO:
EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
Dr. Hayward opens the door.
MIKE
Hi, Dr. Hayward, I'd like to talk to
Donna?
HAYWARD
(smells the beer)
She's upstairs getting ready for
bed, Mike. Hope you're not drinking
and driving.
MIKE
We're all pretty broken up about
what happened today. Besides, Bobby's
driving.
HAYWARD
(pause, firmly)
I'll see if she wants to come down.
Mike, if you wouldn't mind waiting
out here.
Dr. Hayward closes the door. Mike turns, makes a "what can
you do" gesture to Bobby.
BOBBY
(yells back to him)
Get it in gear, Snake!
CUT TO:
INT. HAYWARD HOUSE UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
Dr. Hayward knocks on the door and enters Donna's bedroom
CUT TO:
INT. DONNA'S BEDROOM - DAY
A contrite Harriet sits on the bed, waiting, as her father

 
enters.
HAYWARD
Where's your sister?
HARRIET
I'm gonna tell it to you and I'm
gonna tell it to you straight.
HAYWARD
All right.
HARRIET
See that window?
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
On her headset, Lucy the dispatcher answers an incoming call.
LUCY
Sheriff's Office... Sheriff's out
right now, Dr. Hayward, but I can
patch you through to him...
She patches the phone line into a radio dispatch line.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
The Sheriff's cruiser is parked among the crush of cars in
the roadhouse parking lot.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S CRUISER - NIGHT
Steadman and Cooper are in the front seat. Cooper is whittling
a small stick with a pocket knife. Through the windshield,
they have a prime view of "Hemingway's", behind the Roadhouse
building. About twenty motorcycles, mostly Harleys, are parked
outside.
We hear the cruiser's two-way radio kick on.

LUCY'S VOICE
Sheriff, I got a call for you from
Dr. Hayward...
STEADMAN
(picking up the mic
and responding)
Put him through...
INTERCUT:
INT. HAYWARD HOUSE SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Dr. Hayward on the phone. Harriet peeks out at him from the
bedroom door.
HAYWARD
Dan, my daughter Donna's snuck out
of the house, I don't know where she
went, I'm very worried about her.
Cooper nods, not surprised.
STEADMAN
You rest easy. I'll put out an all
points for her, we'll keep our eyes
peeled
HAYWARD
Thanks, Dan. Keep me posted
STEADMAN
You bet.
Hayward hangs up. STAY with Steadman and Cooper.
COOPER
Of course she went out.
STEADMAN
Meaning what?
COOPER
How else is she gonna lead us to
that biker?

STEADMAN
(trying not to appear
confused)
Right.
COOPER
(pause; continues to
whittle)
You know why I'm whittling?
STEADMAN
(playing along)
Why are you whittling?
COOPER
Because that's the kind of thing you
do in a town where a yellow light
still means slow down, not speed up.
(he smiles)
Couple a' months of this and I'll
have that clarinet I always wanted.
He whistles "Rhapsody in Blue" again. Steadman looks at him.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Dr. Hayward opens the front door. Mike hastily puts out his
cigarette. We hear the whine of Mrs. Hayward's electric
wheelchair approaching the front door.
HAYWARD
Mike, Donna's not here. I've notified
the sheriff...
MIKE
What do you mean, she snuck out?
HAYWARD
Maybe you have some idea of where
(more)
HAYWARD (cont.)
she might have gone, maybe you could
help us find her.

MIKE
We'll find her. Don't you worry.
He runs back to Bobby's car, jumps in.
MIKE
Roadhouse.
Bobby floors it.
CUT TO:
INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT
Donna looks at her watch, looks around uneasily. The pool
players and patrons are grouped around the room, watching
her, whispering to each other about her. SHORTY, the
Neanderthal-looking pool hall owner, comes out from the
backroom through a beaded curtain and approaches Donna.
SHORTY
Sweetheart...
She takes a step back from him.
SHORTY
...hey, settle down, is your name
Donna?
DONNA
Yeah.
SHORTY
Police were by here earlier. Joey
said he'll meet you at the roadhouse.
DONNA
Thanks.
SHORTY
(as she heads for the
door)
Don't mention it. Come back any time.
Set you up with a free rack.

 
CUT TO:
EXT. POOL HALL - NIGHT
Donna gets on her bike and heads off down the road to the
Roadhouse, which we can see in the distance.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Mike and Bobby drive up and park. They get out of the car.
INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT
Steadman and Cooper watch Mike and Bobby head into the
Roadhouse.
COOPER
(matter of fact, still
whittling)
There's liable to be a little trouble
this evening.
Steadman looks at him. Takes a sip of coffee. And a bite of
doughnut.
CUT TO:
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
A warm but slightly seedy honky-tonk. A GIRL SINGER in black
leather is up on the small stage, fronting a four-piece,
avant-garde rock COMBO. She's singing a song called "The
Nightingale."
At a quiet booth near the back, Ed Hurley and Norma Jennings
are holding hands across the table.
NORMA
Drapes?
ED
Drapes. Lots of 'em.

 
NORMA
Ed, please, you know how I feel about
you; don't do it for me, do it for
yourself, pull the pin, it's Tammy
Wynette time, darlin'.
ED
Yeah? What about you and Hank?
NORMA
(obviously frightened
at the thought)
I told you, I'm gonna give Hank his
walkin' papers.
ED
Before or after he gets his parole?
NORMA
Ed, I love you, I'm gonna do what's
right... for both of us.
ED
(making light of it)
Your sweetheart's husband's in the
joint for manslaughter, the word
"parole" has a nasty ring to it.
She manages a smile. Looking up, Ed sees Mike and Bobby enter
the Roadhouse, look around and head for the bar.
CUT TO:
FIVE BIKERS
Some of the clean-cut group we saw during opening credits,
seated at a table down front, watching the singer. One of
them, JOEY, spots Mike and Bobby at the bar.
JOEY
(looks at his watch,
to the others)
Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.
Mike and Bobby see Joey and the bikers. Bobby points a
menacing finger at Joey.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Donna parks her bike beside the Roadhouse and heads for the
door.
CUT TO:
INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT
Steadman and Cooper watch Donna enter the Roadhouse.
COOPER
(still whittling)
Looks like sooner than later.
He finishes whittling, looks at the stick, puts it in his
mouth and blows; he's made a whistle.
COOPER
Why don't you whistle for a little
back-up?
Steadman picks up his radio microphone.
STEADMAN
(the slightest bit
testy)
I can see which way the wind's
blowing.
(into the mic)
Lucy, this is Dan, can we get a backup unit down here at the Roadhouse?
Make that two back-up units. And
call Will Hayward, tell him we found
his daughter and she's fine.
He looks over at Cooper. Cooper makes a "thumbs-up."
CUT TO:
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Donna enters the Roadhouse and looks around. She stops short

 
when she sees Mike and Bobby at the bar. Mike sees Donna.
DONNA
(to herself)
Damn...
MIKE
(yells)
Hey! Everybody's looking for you!
What are you sneakin' around for?!
Reaction throughout the bar. Mike and Bobby rise and start
towards her. Ed looks up from the back booth, sees them.
Donna sees Joey and the other bikers at the front of the
room. Mike and Bobby see her looking at Joey and put two and
two together. Mike grabs Donna.
MIKE
It's the same thing! You and Laura
are exactly the same!
DONNA
Take your hands off me!
Mike pushes Donna hard against the wall. Joey and the other
bikers rise. The Singer stops singing, the band starts to
tail off. Ed rises from his booth.
NORMA
Watch your back, Eddie.
ED
(to Mike, crossing
the room)
That's enough!
As Ed moves towards Mike, Bobby dips a hand into his letter
jacket pocket and slips on a set of brass knuckles. The bikers
start towards Mike and Bobby.
DONNA
You heard him, stay away from me!
MIKE
I didn't hear dick!

 
Ed moves past Bobby and grabs Mike's arm. Bobby hits down on
the back of Ed's head with the knuckles and Ed goes down
with a groan.
BOBBY
Lights out, Mr. Goodwrench.
The band members are already packing their instruments.
Patrons are backing away.
CUT TO:
THE BIKERS
Close the last few yards with a rush and the fight is on.
Mike lets go of Donna. She backs into the shadows. The
fighting is hard and vicious. Mike and Bobby have a size and
weight advantage, and are given to dirty fighting, but it's
countered by the bikers superior numbers and technique.
Approaching SIRENS are heard in the distance.
CUT TO:
INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT
As they watch patrons pile out the front exit and the sounds
of the fight reach them, Steadman goes to open his door.
Cooper stops him.
COOPER
Not just yet.
Steadman stops.
CUT TO:
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Joey hears the sirens, sees Donna slipping away, says to his
compatriots...
JOEY
You guys got it covered?
ANOTHER BIKER
No sweat.

The biker knocks Mike back with an uppercut. The SIRENS are
very close now. Joey moves over to Donna, grabs her by the
hand.
DONNA
Joey-JOEY
Come with me.
(lowering his voice)
I'll take you to James.
He leads her towards a rear exit. The fight continues behind
them.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
As Joey and Donna exit the rear of the roadhouse, two State
Trooper patrol cars are roaring into the parking lot. They
slam to a halt near the front entrance and four TROOPERS
pour out of the cars towards the Roadhouse.
CUT TO:
INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT
Steadman and Cooper watch Donna and Joey hop onto the back
of his motorcycle and he stomps the engine to life. Steadman
and Cooper look at each other.
STEADMAN
Joey Paulson. That's a "J."
COOPER
He's taking her to somebody else.
Steadman looks at him again.
STEADMAN
I suppose you want me to follow them
at a discreet distance.

 
COOPER
Dan, you're all right.
Steadman starts the car.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Joey and Donna ride out a rear driveway exit. Steadman and
Cooper follow at a discreet distance.
CUT TO:
INT. JOEY'S MOTORCYCLE - NIGHT
Donna grabs Joey's back. Joey looks in his rearview mirror.
INTERCUT:
JOEY'S POV - THE MIRROR
Joey sees Steadman's cruiser behind them.
JOEY
(to Donna)
Hold on!
Joey guns it up Sparkwood Mountain Road.
CUT TO:
STEADMAN AND COOPER'S POV
Through the windshield, as the motorcycle pulls away.
STEADMAN
(deadpan)
Gee, you think they spotted us?
COOPER
Gimme a doughnut.
CUT TO:

1 
EXT. JOEY'S MOTORCYCLE - NIGHT
Joey reaches the top of the hill, glances behind him, smiles,
then turns right off the road and into the woods. Within
moments they completely disappear. Pause. Steadman's cruiser
reaches the top of the hill and continues straight past the
turnoff.
CUT TO BLACK:
END ACT FIVE

1 
ACT SIX
FADE IN:
EXT. WOODS ROAD - NIGHT
Steadman's cruiser is stopped by the side of this remote
road.
CUT TO:
INT. CRUISER - NIGHT
Steadman and Cooper have the windows open, listening. Cooper
takes a deep breath.
COOPER
Man... smell those trees. Smell those
Ponderosa Pines.
We hear a far-off sound of a motor; it could be a motorcycle.
STEADMAN
I think I hear it.
The sound fades.
COOPER
(pointing in the
direction of the
sound)
What's down there?
STEADMAN
Logging road. The only access is
from the Packard Mill.
He starts the engine and executes a fast turn.
STEADMAN
(angry at himself)
And I told Hayward his daughter was
okay.
COOPER
My fault, Dan, not yours.

1 

The cruiser flies down the road past a sign that reads:
"PACKARD MILL EXIT, 5 MILES."
CUT TO:
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
A quiet clearing in the woods. SOUND of an approaching
motorcycle. Joey and Donna drive out of the woods into the
clearing. Joey stops the cycle. Donna gets off. Joey turns
off the engine. Night sounds and silence. They wait. We hear
sirens, way off in the distance.
Donna hears the sound of a motorcycle. It comes closer. James
Hurley rides into the clearing on his cycle. He nods to Joey.
JAMES
Thanks, Joey.
JOEY
No problem, James.
Joey fires up his cycle, nods to Donna and rides off, James
kills the engine and gets off his cycle. The sound of Joey's
bike fades away.
James and Donna look at each other. They embrace.
DONNA
She loved you so much. You must be
dying inside.
They separate.
JAMES
And you...
(a different thought)
I still can't believe it. I don't
know if I'll ever believe it. I'll
never see her again.
(fights back tears)
DONNA
They're looking for you, I didn't
(more)

1 
DONNA (cont.)
tell them anything, but I have to
tell you-JAMES
I'm gonna talk to them. But I think
they're going to lock me up-DONNA
Why?
JAMES
I don't have any alibi for last night-(anguished)
I was with her, I saw her last night.
She snuck out, we went riding. Out
here. I have to explain this to you.
Donna's silent, waiting.
JAMES
We had a fight. She told me some
things. About her, about herself.
She said, "There are things about
me. Even Donna doesn't know me."
DONNA
What do you mean?

I'm
she
let
she

JAMES
telling you, there
was involved with,
herself get pulled
thought you'd hate

were things
things she
into, things
her for.

DONNA
Tell me what you're talking about.
JAMES
She told me these things, then she
said she wanted me to be a part of
it, she wanted to be with me but she
couldn't help herself...
DONNA
James...

1 

JAMES
She wanted me to get high with her
last night. She was different, she
was on something. It was kind of
like a nightmare... Donna, she was a
different person. This is why I had
to see you, it all makes some kind
of terrible sense that she died,
that someone killed her, I don't
know, I can't explain it-DONNA
(leveling with him)
I knew her. I knew her better than
she thought.
JAMES
Did she ever tell you any of this?
DONNA
She didn't have to. Sometimes it was
just a look on her face. There were
things that Mike and Bobby said-JAMES
Mike and Bobby. Those bastards! They
were involved with this, I don't
know how exactly--but she said you
weren't in on any of it.
DONNA
I was her friend. I wanted to help
her but whenever we got too close to
it she always seemed too ashamed-JAMES
I got really mad at her last night,
she was screaming stuff at me, crazy
stuff, people she was seeing, people
she met through Mike and Bobby, people
she started seeing again, and Donna,
she said something about a guy getting
killed--

1 
DONNA
Who?
JAMES
She didn't say, but she said Bobby
told her that he killed this guy-DONNA
Oh my God...
JAMES
I didn't know whether to believe any
of it, half the time she wasn't making
any sense, but then when they found
her this morning...
DONNA
James, what happened last night?
JAMES
She was hysterical, I couldn't calm
her down, it was after midnight, we
started driving down the Hill, I
could hardly keep her on the bike, I
was trying to hold onto her, it was
like she wanted to jump off right
onto the highway--we stopped at the
light at Sparkwood and "21" and she
did something so strange, she grabbed
me around the neck and she screamed
she loved me--I looked in her eyes,
they were clear, it was like she was
Laura again. She was so sad. She
sounded so desperate, I'll never
forget it... then she ran off...
that was the last time I saw her...
the way she said it, that she loved
me... I let her go and she died...
He can't fight back the tears. She starts to cry. They blindly
move into each others arms.
DONNA
It's not your fault... it's not your
fault...

1 
Her face moves up close to his. Their tears intermingle.
DONNA
It's okay... it's okay...
She strokes the back of his head. He squeezes her. The
comforting moves more towards need.
DONNA
James... James, it's okay...
His lips find hers. They kiss with urgent, building passion,
yielding to it and to each other. Then something stops them
both simultaneously. They pull slightly away and look at
each other.
DONNA
Oh my God...
JAMES
I'm sorry.
DONNA
Oh my God...
She touches his cheek lightly. He looks at her.
JAMES
I changed my mind. I'm not sorry.
She gently lays her head on his shoulder. Approaching SIRENS
are heard again in the distance.
JAMES
(reacting to the sirens)
I've got to go to the police. I'm
gonna tell 'em what I told you. I
don't have an alibi. After she left
I just rode around most of the night.
When Bobby finds out about me and
Laura-DONNA
I think they already know.

1 
JAMES
I want you to watch out for those
two.
DONNA
(remembering)
James, that necklace you gave Laura,
the other half of the gold heart,
you've got to give it to me.
JAMES
Why?
DONNA
They found the other half, where she
was killed. They think the killer
has the other half. If you go down
there with the necklace and no alibi-JAMES
What about you?
DONNA
I'll get rid of it.
JAMES
No-DONNA
I'll hide it somewhere.
JAMES
All right.
(looks at her directly)
Let's bury it, right here.
She senses that this act is about what just happened between
them. With the heel of his boot, James digs out a shallow
trench. He opens his hand, they both look at the necklace.
He lets the necklace slide out of his hand into the hole.
She kneels down and covers the necklace with dirt. James
reaches back, comes up with a white rock and uses it to mark
the burial spot.
The sirens come closer.

1 
JAMES
We should go. I'll take you home-DONNA
We shouldn't be seen together. I
snuck out to see you, there's a curfew-JAMES
Climb on.
They move to his cycle. He climbs on and starts it. She gets
on the back. He turns back to her, she slides her arms around
him. They take off. Up through the woods, towards the highway.
CUT TO:
EXT. DIRT PATH - NIGHT
Donna and James ride through the woods. They come to a sharp
crest, onto the surface of the highway and speed off past
the sign that reads: "PACKARD MILL EXIT 5 MILES."
CUT TO:
INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT
Steadman and Cooper sit parked off the exit, watching the
highway and the Mill Road. Cooper's leaning out of the window,
looking up at the night sky.
COOPER
(overawed)
There's the Little Dipper... Orion's
belt... I never saw so many stars...
They hear James' approaching motorcycle. Moments later it
flies by their line of sight.
COOPER
What goes around, comes around.
Steadman steers the cruiser out after them, hits the siren
and lights.
CUT TO:

1 
EXT. JAMES' MOTORCYCLE - NIGHT
James looks back at the Sheriff's cruiser and decides not to
run. He slows and pulls off the side of the road. Moments
later, Steadman's cruiser pulls up behind them.
INTERCUT:
INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT
Steadman sees who's on the bike.
STEADMAN
That's not Joey that's James Hurley.
COOPER
He'll do.
Steadman draws his gun, picks up the microphone and flips on
his external speaker.
STEADMAN
(amplified)
James, stand away from the bike,
stand away from the girl and put
your hands on top of your head.
James follows the instructions.
DONNA
(moving towards
Steadman)
He didn't do anything!
COOPER
She's probably right.
Exasperated, Steadman looks at him.
CUT TO:
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
A couple of TV NEWS CREWS and some REPORTERS are set up
outside the station, as Steadman drives up in the cruiser.
The Crews move in and tape Steadman and Cooper as they escort

1 
Donna and James into the station. James is wearing handcuffs.
NEWSMEN
(variously)
Sheriff, is he a suspect? What's his
name? Is he being charged? What about
the girl, are they both suspects?
Sheriff, what can you tell us?
STEADMAN
Nothing for you folks at this time...
no comment.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
Seated near the front desk, Dr. Hayward rises as Steadman
and Cooper enter with Donna and James. Andy Brennan comes
towards them as well.
STEADMAN
Will, I'm gonna release her to you
but I want her back up here for
questioning first thing in the
morning... Andy, give him a phone
call and take James into holding-JAMES
My mom's out of town.
STEADMAN
We're gonna have to hold you
overnight.
ANDY
Dan, we've got those guys from the
Roadhouse back there-COOPER
Separate cell.
Before Andy leads James off, Donna touches James' arm.
Hayward, Steadman and Cooper notice the tenderness in her
gesture. James eyes move from Donna, to Hayward and back to
Donna.

1 

JAMES
It's gonna be all right.
Andy and James move off.
HAYWARD
Thank you, Dan.
Hayward and Donna move towards a side door. Hayward puts an
arm around his daughter and they exit.
CUT TO:
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION SIDE EXIT - NIGHT
On a side of the building away from the reporters, Hayward
opens the car door for Donna and she gets in.
CUT TO:
INT. HAYWARD'S CAR - NIGHT
Hayward gets in beside Donna and closes the door.
DONNA
I'm sorry, Dad.
HAYWARD
Donna, I'm sure you understand what
you've put your and mother and I
through tonight. I also know you
well enough to know you wouldn't
have done it unless you had a very
good reason.
(she nods)
But we do have another problem facing
us, young lady...
(mock stern)
Where... is Harriet's bicycle?
DONNA
(breathes a sigh of
relief, has to think)
I left it at the Roadhouse.

1 
HAYWARD
Well, we'll go pick it up.
(starts the car)
And I understand you promised Harriet
you'd put some air in the back tire.
DONNA
Yes I did.
Hayward smiles, touches her head, lovingly, looks at her.
HAYWARD
We're so thankful to have a daughter
like you.
Her eyes glisten, she smiles, nods, looks away. Hayward drives
off.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HOLDING CELL AREA - NIGHT
Andy finishes putting James' belt and the contents of his
pockets in a large envelope, then leads James through a
doorway into the holding cell area corridor.
On their way to the cell, they pass Mike and Bobby in a
separate cell. Mike and Bobby rise when they see James. Bobby
fixates on James, points a finger at him as he passes.
BOBBY
You.
James stops and looks at him, as Andy opens the door of a
nearby cell.
BOBBY
When you least expect it.
ANDY
That could constitute a threat,
Briggs.
BOBBY
(cold as ice)
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

1 

James just looks at him.
ANDY
Let's go, James.
James enters the cell. Andy closes and locks the door.
ANDY
Stick your hands out.
James sticks out his hands, Andy unlocks and removes the
handcuffs.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION FRONT DESK - NIGHT
A weary Steadman and Cooper meet near the water cooler.
STEADMAN
(hands him a Dixie
cup)
Buy you a drink?
COOPER
Dan, I forgot to ask you; can you
recommend to me a good, inexpensive
hotel or motel? Now it doesn't have
to be fancy and I mean that.
STEADMAN
I can get you a good rate up at the
Great Northern.
COOPER
Because my guess is I'm going to be
here for awhile and you know a lot
of these motel chains that advertise
on TV promise a reasonable rate but
then you get there and it's a
different story. All I need is a
bed, a bathroom, a telephone and
sometimes a television, in the
unlikely event that one day I'll get
a chance to knock off early.

1 

STEADMAN
(slight pause)
I can get you a good rate up at the
Great Northern.
COOPER
Sold.
Cooper offers his hand. Steadman shakes it.
COOPER

Tomorrow comes early.
STEADMAN
I'll have Lucy make the arrangements
for you with the Hotel.
COOPER
I'll get my gear together.

switches on his tape
recorder, speaks
into the mic)
Diane, it's 12:28 a.m., looks like
I'll be staying locally at a place
called the Great Northern Hotel-Sheriffs getting me a rate...
He's gone. Steadman crosses back towards his office, where
Lucy calls him from the switchboard.
LUCY
Sheriff, just got a call from Mrs.
Packard up at the Lodge, a possible
prowler?
STEADMAN
Probably raccoons in the garbage
again. I'll take it, Lucy, tell 'em
I'm on my way.
Steadman heats out.

Steadman's cruiser turns off the steep road and into the

homestead. He parks near the rear of the house, exits the
car and moves towards the house.
As Steadman nears the kitchen door, Giovanna opens it.
GIOVANNA
Hello Sheriff.
STEADMAN
Hey, Jo... understand there's a
prowler up here.
GIOVANNA
(as he enters)
Yes there is. Right over here.
She pulls him the rest of the way in, turns off the lights
and in the dark, they kiss passionately.
GIOVANNA
I've been wanting to do that all
day. I felt so sad. So alone.
STEADMAN
(strokes her hair)
Well, the sheriffs here now.
They kiss again. He holds her. They are standing in front of
a large picture window, with a panoramic view looking down

GIOVANNA
I used to think it was so peaceful
here. Everything's changed. Do you
feel it?

COOPER
Diane... 6:18 a.m., room 315, Great
Northern Hotel up here in Twin
Peaks. Slept pretty well. Nonsmoking room. No tobacco smell.
That's a nice consideration for the
business traveler. A hint of
douglas fir needles in the air. As
Sheriff Truman indicated they
would, everything this hotel
promised, they've delivered: clean,
reasonably priced accommodations...
telephone works... bathroom in
really tip-top shape... no drips,
plenty of hot water with good,
steady pressure... could be a sidebenefit of the waterfall just
outside my window... firm mattress,
but not too firm... and no lumps
like that time I told you about
down in El Paso... Diane, what a
nightmare that was, but of course
you've heard me tell that story
once or twice before. Haven't tried
the television. Looks like cable,
probably no reception problems. But
the true test of any hotel, as you
know, is that morning cup of

COOPER
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
AUDREY
Can I sit here?
COOPER
(pleasantly)
Miss Horne, unless I miss my guess,
your father is Benjamin Horne, the
owner of this fine establishment,
so I guess you can sit anywhere you
like. And I'd also like to add that
it would be my pleasure.
Audrey sits, a little confused, runs a hand over her
forehead.
AUDREY
You know, sometimes I get so
flushed... it's interesting.




COOPER
Were you a friend of Laura
Palmer's?
AUDREY
Not exactly.
COOPER
Her father works for your father.
Did you know each other growing up?
AUDREY
Oh, we knew each other...
COOPER
But there was something about her
you didn't like.
AUDREY
Everybody liked Laura. She was just
Little Miss Perfect. Laura tutored
my older brother Johnny three times
a week. Johnny's twenty-seven and
he's in the third grade. He's got
emotional problems; it runs in the
family. Do you like my ring?
(hold out her hand to show
a big rock)
Very nice.

COOPER

AUDREY
My father bought it for me. My
father was crazy about Laura. He
bought her a pony when she was
nine, but he let her father say it
was from him. Its name was Troy.

left palm)
Do your palms ever itch? Cooper
studies her benignly.

EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - MORNING
The trucker, LEO JOHNSON, is obsessively cleaning the cab of
his semi rig with a dustbuster. A bucket of hot water, some
sponges, and a hose are at the ready nearby. We see that
Leo's name is stenciled on the rig's door, along with the
name, "BIG PUSSYCAT." SHELLY JOHNSON, in her waitress
uniform, comes up to the truck.
SHELLY
Leo, honey? I gotta go to work now,
Norma'll be here any sec... Leo?
Leo turns off the dustbuster and turns to her.
LEO
Did you finish cleaning my boots?
SHELLY
They're all done, and I did the
laundry, too.
All of it?

LEO

SHELLY
Well, yeah.
LEO
No you didn't.
He grabs a used grocery bag full of dirty clothes from the
cab and flings it at her.
SHELLY
Sure, Leo, when I get home I'll-LEO
Now, Shelly.
Okay.

SHELLY

Shelly starts back towards the house.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - MORNING
Shelly dumps the clothes out of the grocery bag onto a
laundry basket in front of the washer. She shakes out the
clothes before putting them in.




She stops short when she sees a large, dark red bloodstain on
a faded blue cowboy work shirt. She starts to tremble. She
hears a car horn beep outside. She looks out the window, sees
Norma's car pull in near the truck but she doesn't see Leo.
She hears the screen door open and bang shut in the other
room.
LEO'S VOICE
Shelly? Norma's here.
Shelly makes a brave decision: quickly folds the bloodstained
shirt and stashes it behind the washer, dumps the rest of the
clothes in the washer, closes the door and starts it just as
Leo comes in the room.
LEO
Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's
here?
SHELLY
I heard you, Leo.
She starts out. He catches her by the arm.
LEO
I'm gonna come by the diner
sometime today. Be a good girl and
save me a piece 'a pie.
He pinches her cheek softly and holds it.
SHELLY
(manages a smile)
Sure, Leo.
He works her cheek for a moment, squeezing a bit harder.
Shelly hides her fear.

Bobby hit Ed? Weird.
They look at each other, each knowing the other's secret, but
not saying so.
NORMA
Ed's got a concussion. Then Bobby

Hey, Sheriff: three for three.
Truman tries to chew, but holds up his hand to be patient.
Cooper sits.




COOPER (CONT'D)
Number one, James Hurley: as soon
as his lawyer gets here, we bring
him up from Cell Four and talk to
him straight. He was in love with
Laura Palmer, my bet is she told
him whatever dirt she knew about
Bobby and Mike and who knows what
else... if James plays ball, we
send him off with our blessings and
a firm reminder to watch his back
when Mike and Bobby hit the
streets...
(Truman nods, trying to
chew fast)
Then we'll have a chat with those
two perpetrators, let's run a top
to bottom on Bobby's vehicle and in
the meantime, let's find out what
the autopsy report on Laura Palmer
gives us.
(he rises)
I've got the rest of the day mapped
out. I'll meet you back here in
Interrogation... I really have to
urinate. By the way, the coffee at
the Great Northern? Incredible.
He exits, just as Truman finally swallows his mouthful of
bearclaw.

JAMES HURLEY is seated, next to his LAWYER, across from
Truman, as Cooper enters and sits down beside the Sheriff.
TRUMAN
James has been advised of his
rights.
COOPER
James, you were placed under arrest
for suspicion of murder, the murder
of Laura Palmer. You have no
previous criminal record, is that
correct?
JAMES
None. No, sir.




Cooper turns on the VCR and we see the same videotape of
Laura and Donna at the picnic that we saw earlier. James
watches the video.
COOPER
James, did you shoot this
videotape?
Cooper fast forwards to the freeze frame of the motorcycle
reflected in Laura's eye.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Isn't that your cycle, James?
JAMES
Yes, sir, it is. The three of us
went up there three Sundays ago.
COOPER
(gently)
James, you were in love with Laura.
(James is silent)
The two of you were seeing each
other secretly. No one else at the
school, or any of her friends knew
about it; she was the homecoming
queen, her boyfriend was the
captain of the football team. How
much longer did you think you could
keep this relationship secret?
JAMES
It was secret because that's the
way she wanted it.
COOPER
Why do you suppose that was, James?
Do think it had something to do
with Bobby?
JAMES
It had everything to do with Bobby.
COOPER
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?
JAMES
I think so.
COOPER
Did you know that Laura was using
cocaine?




Yes.

JAMES
(pause)

COOPER
Did you ever take cocaine with her?
JAMES
No, I tried to get her to stop.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw her?
JAMES
Two nights ago. The night she died.
For about three hours. She snuck
out of the house about 9: About
12:30 I stopped the bike at the
light at Sparkwood and  She
jumped off and ran away. I didn't
see her again.
COOPER
You're sure it was 12:30?
JAMES
Yes, sir, Steve's Liquor Locker was
closing up as we drove by and he
closes right at 12:
COOPER
You and Laura have a fight?
JAMES
Not exactly. But she said she
couldn't see me anymore.
Why?

COOPER

JAMES
She didn't say.
COOPER
Was she high that night?
Yes.

JAMES

COOPER
Where did she get her drugs?




JAMES
I don't know. Most of the time we
were together she was clean.
COOPER
Did she get her drugs from Bobby?
JAMES
I really don't know where she got
'em, she never talked about it. She
didn't like that part of herself.
COOPER
Why did she start using again?
JAMES
(getting emotional)
I don't know. Something happened, a
couple of days ago-COOPER
What happened?
JAMES
I don't know exactly. I think
something scared her. She wouldn't
talk to me, she wouldn't see me for
a couple days-COOPER
Until the last night.
Yes.

JAMES

COOPER
Did she call you that night?
Yes.

JAMES

Cooper looks at Laura's diary, opened in front of him, at the
page for February 5th; the page marked "DAY ONE." He takes
the half-hearted necklace from his pocket.
COOPER
Did you recognize this necklace,

Yes, sir.

LAURA
Okay. It's an important day for me,
James. You've got three guesses why
I'm so happy today.

No.

INT. DONNA HAYWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD lies asleep in bed. The sound of an operatic
aria drifts through the room, originating downstairs. Donna
shifts, starting to waken, stretches and smiles like an
untroubled angel. Then her eyes open and she remembers
Laura's death.
CUT TO:
INT. HAYWARD LIVING ROOM - DAY
Donna enters the room, where her mother, EILEEN, sits in her
wheelchair doing elaborate needlepoint, listening to the
opera on the hi-fi.
Mom?
Mom?

DONNA
(Eileen doesn't hear her)

EILEEN
Oh, good morning, dear, I didn't
hear you come down.
She uses a remote control to turn down the volume of the hifi and takes her daughter's hand.
DONNA
Mom, it's ten-thirty, why didn't
you wake me? I was supposed to go
down to the sherrif's-EILEEN
They called this morning and said
they could wait until tomorrow to
see you. Your father and I thought
you should rest. You woke us crying
in your sleep last night, do you
remember?
DONNA
No, really?
EILEEN
We feel so badly for you, we're so
sorry.




DONNA
(sits beside her)
Mom, it's so strange. I know I
should be sad, and I am, part of me
is, but I... it's like I'm having
the most beautiful dream and the
most terrible nightmare all at
once.
EILEEN
Your father told me you went out
last night to meet a boy named
James Hurley. Does this have
anything to do with him?
DONNA
(nods, decides to confide)
Can this be between you and me?
EILEEN
(takes her hand)
Of course it can.
DONNA
James and Laura were seeing each
other the last two months. They
fell in love. I was the only one
who knew about it. James was so
good for her, you don't know how
troubled Laura was, the kind of
trouble she was in and how much she
wanted to get away from Bobby-EILEEN
I've been waiting for something
like this about Bobby. And what
about Mike?
DONNA
Mom, Laura and I made a pact. We
wanted to get away from them, from
both of them-EILEEN
Are you saying you think Bobby had
something to do with Laura's death?
DONNA
I don't know. I think Bobby's
dangerous, I think he's capable of
almost anything.




EILEEN
What did you tell the police?
DONNA
Nothing, I don't have any proof of
anything and what's terrible is
James was with Laura the night she
died, but Mom, I know he didn't do
it. Last night, I had to see him,
we were the two closest people to
her in the world. But I feel so
bad...
EILEEN
Why, angel?
DONNA
Because we realized that all this
time... we were the ones who were
falling in love. I feel like I've
betrayed my best friend...
(tears)
...but if that's true, then why do
I feel so happy?
Donna falls into her mother's arms.

LELAND (CONT'D)

He pushes the phone and everything else on his desk away from
him. He gets up, crosses to a cabinet stereo, turns on the
sound on a modern jazz quartet record, 9/4 time, about as
loud as it can go. Benjamin goes to the Secretary.
BENJAMIN
(quietly)
Take him to the lounge and call Dr.
Jacoby.
She nods, goes to Leland, takes him gently by the arm and
leads him out of the room. Benjamin Horne turns down the
sound on the stereo, goes to the desk and picks up the phone.
BENJAMIN
This is Benjamin Horne, who am I
speaking to?... fine... mahogany
and teak? Well, you can forget
that, Mr. Formaldehyde, I'm picking
up the tab here and you vampires
are not taking a bite out of my
checkbook in order to exploit my
colleague's tragedy... start
thinking lead.
He slams down the phone, just as we hear, from outside...
JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
No, no, no, don't put 'em in my
room, in here, through that door
right there!
JERRY HORNE, Benjamin's younger, wiry brother enters,
followed by four BELLHOPS, carrying a mess of mismatched
samsonite.
BENJAMIN
Good to have you back, Jerry, how
was Paris?
JERRY
(shakes his head)
In a minute...
(turns back to the
Bellhops, points down)
Right THERE, no, no, right THERE!
The Bellhops carefully set the bags down as directed.




JERRY
What's the matter with Leland?
Looks like somebody shot his dog.
The Bellhops all stop and look at Benjamin.
JERRY
What is WITH you guys? I've got a
sandwich in there and I want all
those bags opened--we're looking
till we find it.
The Bellhops hop to it; all the bags are opened. Jerry tosses
clothes around the room until he finds a baguette with brie
wrapped in white paper.
JERRY
Brother Ben, this is the best damn
sandwich I ever ate, it's a
baguette, with brie and butter, had
four of these damn things every day
I was there.
(he reaches in and finds
another one)
Got a couple left--here, try one.
BENJAMIN

Jerry, Leland's daughter was
murdered. And the Norweigans left.

BENJAMIN
No. The deal's off.
JERRY

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION INTERROGATION - DAY
DR. HAYWARD opens the folder containing Laura's autopsy
report, ready to share the results to Truman and Cooper. Dr.
Hayward absentmindedly tugs on a thread sticking out of his
sleeve.
HAYWARD
Harry, as you know, I delivered
Laura. I knew her her entire life;
she was my daughter's best friend.
I couldn't bring myself to do the
postmortem, so last night I called
in Joe Fielding from Fairvale. He
did the work, I assisted, this is
what he found...
(puts on glasses, consults
sheet)
Time of death estimated to be
between midnight and four a.m. What
killed her was loss of blood.
Numerous shallow wounds, no single
one serious enough to have been the
cause of death. Bite marks. On her
tongue, probably self-inflicted.
Lesions on wrists, ankles, and
upper arms, where she was bound.
We're waiting on toxological tests
for drug use. Within the last
twelve hours of her life, she had
sexual relations with at least
three men.
He tugs again on the loose thread of his sleeve; a button
pops off his shirt, hits the table and spins. He takes off
his glasses, wipes his eyes.
COOPER
And you've examined Ronette Pulaski
as well?
HAYWARD
(composing himself)
Yes. Wound patterns are consistent.
In my mind, there's no question the
same perpetrator attacked them
both.

Doc, when, if ever, will Ronette be
able to talk to us?
HAYWARD
She suffered a severe head wound,
it's still too early to tell, add
to that the psychological impact of
the fear, probably witnessing what
happened to Laura before her...
COOPER
The answer's in there somewhere.
Doc Hayward looks at a close-up picture of Laura taken where
she was found on the beach.
HAYWARD
So beautiful. Who would do a thing
like that?
CUT TO:
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY
Mike and Bobby sit on their steel cots. Mike moves to Bobby,
who's hanging his head upside down off the back of the cot,
kneels down beside him and speaks to him quietly.
MIKE
Hey Bopper... since when does Leo
Johnson call me at my parent's
house?
BOBBY
Leo called you?
MIKE
Yesterday. He was looking for you.
He wanted to know where the other
half of the money was.
BOBBY
What'd you tell him, Snake?
MIKE
Hey, as far as I knew, he didn't
have any of it yet. I thought the
deal was we were supposed to give
it to him today.
BOBBY
I gave him half already.




MIKE
(surprised and a little
angry)
When did you see him?
BOBBY
Hey, I saw him the other night,
okay?
MIKE
What night? You mean Thursday
night?
BOBBY
Yeah, Thursday.
MIKE
Wait a minute, the night we
followed Laura back to her place
after she left your house-BOBBY
Check. We had a couple brewskis and
I dropped you off.
Check.

MIKE

BOBBY
(lowering his voice
further)
And then I went to see Leo, cause I
had this money burning a ten
thousand dollar hole in my pocket.
MIKE
What about the other half?
BOBBY
It's in Laura's safe deposit box.
MIKE
You didn't get it back from her?
BOBBY
She was supposed to hand it over
today. Then she went and checked
out on us.
MIKE
So how we gonna get that ten grand
for Leo?




BOBBY
(wise-ass)
I don't know, Snake. Maybe we could
sell light bulbs door-to-door.
MIKE
That's great, that's just great.
This isn't funny, man.
BOBBY
You see me laughing?
MIKE
We're lucky we're in jail, you know
what's gonna go down when we get
out? Maybe we ought'a figure a way
to stay in here-BOBBY
(grabs his shirt)
Don't even think like that--and
don't mention one word about Leo
Johnson, you do not know Leo
Johnson.
MIKE
But what about-The holding area door opens. Hawk leads James back in and
takes him back to his cell. Bobby jumps up from his cot and
moves to the bars.
BOBBY
Oh, look at that. Here comes that
accident waiting to happen.
HAWK
That could constitute a threat,
Briggs.
BOBBY
Gee, I'm sorry.
James enters his cell.

INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Truman and Cooper make their way towards the front, as ED
HURLEY, a bandage on his head, rises from his seat.




TRUMAN
Hey Ed, how's that coconut?
ED
Kind'a tender. My pride's hurt
worse.
TRUMAN
Yeah, since when can some 18 yearold punk take Big Ed Hurley out,
even if he was wearing knuckle
dusters. Ed, this is Agent Dale
Cooper.
COOPER
(shakes hands)
Any relation to James?
ED
I'm his uncle. His mother's out of
town, called this morning, asked me
to come on over. You fellas plan on
holding him a while?
COOPER
No, we can release him into your
custody.
Truman looks at him.
ED
Let me understand; is James being
charged?
COOPER
I had one small doubt which James
has satisfactorily cleared up for
me. He didn't kill anybody. But you
tell him to be careful; we're going
to have to release Mike and Bobby
today as well.
Will do.

ED

Lucy calls from the switchboard.




LUCY
Agent Cooper, I've got a call for
you from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield,
sounds like long distance, it has
that open-air sound where it sounds
like the wind blowing, you know,
like wind through the trees-Cooper moves towards her to take the call. Ed takes Truman by
the arm and lowers his voice.
ED
Harry, I've been thinking about
last night at the Roadhouse:
something's not right.
TRUMAN
(kidding him)
Yeah, when I first saw the bandage
I thought Nadine might've gotten
wind of you and Norma.
ED
Harry, if Nadine'd gotten wind of
me and Norma, I'd be playing harp
for the Heavenly All-Stars. No, the
thing is I can remember Mike and
Bobby grabbing Donna, I stood up to
walk over and I got all
lightheaded, I was out on my feet
before I got there, I don't even
remember getting hit-TRUMAN
What are you saying?
ED
I'm pretty sure my beer was
drugged. And you know who was
tending bar last night.
Truman thinks a moment, then nods.
CUT TO:
COOPER

Alright, Albert, bring the boys,

EXT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
Carrying a small tray of sandwiches, Norma is going into the
hardware store down the block from the Double R Diner. She
holds the door open for a woman who's exiting, obscured
behind a big bag of hardware. It's NADINE HURLEY. Norma sees
her first.
NORMA
(pleasantly)
Hi, Nadine.
NADINE
What are you doing here, Norma?
NORMA
(pleasantly)
I might ask you the same question.
NADINE
(a hint of aggressiveness)
And I will tell you: I've gotten
all new drapes for my house. Ed
bought them for me yesterday at
Gentle Jim's and we installed them
together.They're a beige sheer. I
was up all night, do you know what
I was doing?
NORMA
(a little worried)
No, I don't.
NADINE
I was inventing a noiseless,
completely silent drape runner. And
do you know how it works, do you
know what makes it work? The thing
I thought of at four this morning
while I was waiting for my husband
to be released from intensive care?
NORMA
What's that?




Nadine takes a package out of the bag, wrenches it open and
grabs a handfull of...
NADINE
Cotton balls. By God, those
things'll be quiet now.
Nadine moves off. Norma enters the store.

Mom still out of town?
ED
Yeah. She's still out of town.

Mike sits at the table, as Dale Cooper enters.
COOPER
So tell me, Mike, what are you
doing hanging around with a guy
like Bobby Briggs?




MIKE
He's my friend.
COOPER
You don't seem like such a bad kid
to me, but Bobby Briggs could drag
you straight into hell. How long
has Donna Hayward been your
girlfriend?
MIKE
Around two years.
COOPER
Why were you screaming at her and
roughing her up last night at the
Roadhouse?
MIKE
That's between her and me.
COOPER
Between you and her, or you, her,
and James Hurley?
MIKE
What's that supposed to mean?
COOPER
You guys were out looking for James
last night-MIKE
That's right, he was fooling around
with Laura, next thing we know
she's dead and he's out fooling
around with Donna-COOPER
You couldn't find James so you
picked a fight with his gang
instead.
MIKE
They started it.
COOPER
After Bobby decked Ed Hurley with a
pair of brass knuckles?




MIKE
He was defending himself--look, I
already spent a night in jail, are
you charging me with something?
COOPER
Settle down there, punk. I could
make one phone call and you'd go so
far away God couldn't find you.
Cooper smiles.

Mike gets the picture.

Truman sits across from Bobby, filling out a report, when
Cooper breezily enters.
COOPER
Hi, Bobby, I was just talking to
Mike. Now before we get started,
have you got your stories straight?
BOBBY
If you tell the truth, you don't
have to get your stories straight.
Besides, the sheriff tells me we're
just in here for fighting and it
was self-defense.
COOPER
Right. Well, I guess you can go
then.
Cooper sits, takes the whistle he whittled out of his pocket
and begins to sand it with a small piece of folded sandpaper.
Truman looks at him.
...now?
Yeah.

Bobby stands and makes his way to the door.

happens to him, we're coming for
you.

They look at each other. Bobby exits. Cooper stands and takes
out his electronic notebook.
COOPER (CONT'D)
What are you sitting around for,
Harry? We got places to go and

JOSIE PACKARD enters the kitchen, a happy look on her face.
JOSIE
On top of the morning to you, Pete.
PETE
No, Josie, the expression is "top

...and it's just barely morning.
JOSIE

So perhaps I should say, "Bottom of

That'd be more like it.

Josie enters with Pete.

Cooper and Truman rise.

TRUMAN
Mrs. Packard, this is Dale Cooper,
FBI.
COOPER
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
JOSIE
Thank you. Can I offer you
gentlemen a cup of joe?
COOPER
Mrs. Packard, you said the magic
word.
TRUMAN
I'd love a cup, thanks.
PETE
I'll get that for you. Mr. Cooper,
how do you take it?
COOPER
Black as midnight on a moonless
night.
PETE
Pretty black.

JOSIE
Please, grab yourself a chair.
They all sit. Out of sight, the little dog barks again.




COOPER
Look at him, what a cute little
fellow, what's his name?
Koro.

JOSIE

COOPER
(filing this away)
Koro. Koro. That means something.
JOSIE
Chinese. I am not sure exactly. My
late husband Andrew named him.
"Big, steaming engine" perhaps?
Cooper starts to bend down to pet Koro, Truman tries to
signal him not to. A growl, a yip and Cooper withdraws his
hand.
COOPER
Mrs. Packard, I'll come right to
the point. Mrs. Packard, I
understand that you'd hired Laura
to come see you twice a week to
help you with your English, is that
correct?
JOSIE
Yes, you see my late husband,
Andrew... I first learned English
from him, when we met in Hong Kong,
but I have learned after his death
that he spoke only in what you
would call "western cliches"-COOPER
That's very interesting, Mrs.
Packard, so you hired Laura to help
you-JOSIE
That is the ticket, because I was
apparently not even saying the
cliches correctly.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw
Laura?
JOSIE
Thursday afternoon, about the time
the mill blew five.




COOPER
That would be five o'clock?
Yes.

JOSIE

COOPER
When did she leave?
JOSIE
After one hour, when the lesson was
finished. I did not see her again.
COOPER
How did she seem to you on Thursday
afternoon?
JOSIE
Something was bothering her but we
did not have a heart-to-heart on
it. She said one thing, though,
which stuck to my mind. She said,
"I think now I know how you feel...
about your husband's death."
COOPER
Did she say what that was in
reference to?
JOSIE
No, but I think of it now like an
old song with a haunting melody
that I can't stop hearing in my
head.
COOPER
Uh-huh. Did you ask her then what
she meant by this?
JOSIE
It was just as she was leaving.
There was no time.
She stares at the floor. Cooper and Truman look at each
other. The phone rings.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
Excuse me, please...
She rises and exits. Cooper smiles strangely at Truman.
COOPER
How long have you been seeing her?




TRUMAN
(about three different
reactions before...)
How did you know?
COOPER
Body language.
TRUMAN
Geez... uh, not long. About six
weeks. Andrew died a year and a
half ago.
Pete sticks his head back in.
PETE
You'd never guess; had to make a
new pot: there was a fish in the
percolator.
Pete exits.
COOPER
Was there an inquest into her
husband's death?
TRUMAN
Yeah. He took his 36-footer out on
Black Lake. He'd just put in a
customized, high performance
engine, there was an explosion on
board. We found pieces of the boat
but nothing of Andrew. It was ruled
accidental.
COOPER
(lowers his voice)
You never found the body?
TRUMAN
Don't look to me like that. He was
like a father to me.
COOPER
Take it easy, Harry, you're so far
above suspicion I can't even see
you through the clouds.

you?...
Josie mouths the word, not at all sure.
CATHERINE (CONT'D)
Shutting down the mill for eight
hours, plus the night-shift, cost
us eighty-seven thousand dollars

that would have made Andrew happy?
She hangs up. Turns and raises her glass and touches glasses

Sing it to somebody else. I'm not

Oh, I'm sorry, did I offend your

CATHERINE
My mistake. I'd gotten used to us

BENJAMIN
Sweetheart, it's all the same to
me.
CATHERINE
Well I'm no schoolgirl either.
What's the next step?
BENJAMIN
(sits down beside her on
the bed)
We may not have to do anything: a
few more local tragedies and Josie
may run that mill into the ground
herself.
CATHERINE
You should have seen her, so proud
and weepy over that little
cheerleader's death, as if she was
the only one in the world with
feelings.
BENJAMIN
But the fact is those losses are
going to look beautiful in the
books.
CATHERINE
With the pace we've set, it'll
still be months before that mill's
bankrupt. I don't know if I can
wait that long. Besides, there's
always a chance my knothead husband

dusty old books.

JACOBY
Treating him? Well, with Johnny,
it's not so much a question of
treating him-COOPER
I understand Laura Palmer was his
tutor.
JACOBY
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
after school. Those were the same
days I'd come to see Johnny and his
mother. Laura was Johnny's
favorite. He knew which day it was,
too, he'd stand just like that,
waiting for her.
COOPER
Does Johnny get out much?
JACOBY
Sure, after his schoolwork... Laura
would take him out on the grounds
hunting for rubber buffalo with his
little suction-cupped bow and arrow
set. Some afternoons, he'd bag the

TRUMAN
Was she here on Wednesday
afternoon?




JACOBY
Yes, she was. I sat in with them.

there's plenty more chips in the
kitchen.




She sits down at the table with them. Major Briggs and his
wife bow their heads but Bobby doesn't.
MAJOR BRIGGS
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly
thankful.
Bobby indifferently moves his meatloaf around the plate and
mashes up the chips with a spoon.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Robert, I was hoping we'd have a
chance to discuss the events of the
past few days. Not the physical
events themselves necessarily, but
the thoughts and feelings
surrounding them.
Bobby rolls his eyes. Major Briggs is undeterred.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Rebellion in a young man of your
age is a necessary fact of life,
and, candidly, a sign of strength.
In other words, I respect your
rebellious nature, Bobby. However,
being your father, I am obligated
to contain that fire of
contrariness within the bounds
established by society as well as
those within our family structure.
Bobby impatiently taps his water glass with his knife.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Bobby, I note your reluctance to
engage in a dialogue with me, your
father. There are times when
silence is golden. Silence can be
taken many ways; as a sign of
intelligence... truth being
invisible... and the quieter we
become, the more we can hear...
Bobby shakes out a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. The Major
calmly and firmly backhands Bobby across the face. The
cigarette flies across the table and spears into the meatloaf
on Betty's plate. Bobby's stunned more than hurt.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
I am a tolerant man, but my
patience has its limits.

MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
"To have his path made clear for
him is the aspiration of every

sheet.
Cooper nods, makes a note as he sips his coffee. As he puts
the notebook away, he looks around and sees the LOG LADY
seated a couple of chairs away, cradling her log and drinking
coffee. Cooper looks back at Truman.
COOPER
(whispers)
Log Lady?
Right.
Hi.

TRUMAN
COOPER

She makes a sour face. Cooper turns back to Truman.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Can I ask her about the log?
Many have.

TRUMAN

Cooper ponders his choices. Norma Jennings comes out of the
kitchen with a piece of cherry pie, moves to Cooper and
Truman and sets down the pie.
NORMA
Evening, Harry.
TRUMAN
Norma, like to have you meet
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
COOPER
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
NORMA
Norma Jennings.
COOPER
I understand your husband, O. Henry
Jennings, is serving twenty-seven
months in state prison for
manslaughter.




NORMA
(good-naturedly)
Yes, he is. I also have a cousin
named Sue who runs a beauty shop in
downtown Butte, Montana.
Cooper takes a bite of pie, closes his eyes and slips into an
ecstatic state.
NORMA (CONT'D)
Maybe I should come back with the
dinner menu.
TRUMAN
No need for me, I'll have the
special.
COOPER
(comes out of it with a
smile)
Where's my paper and pen, I've got
to write a poem about this pie.
TRUMAN
Better get your notebook; wait'll
you taste the special.
COOPER
Mrs. Jennings, is it true that
Laura Palmer used to help you with
the Meals on Wheels program,
delivering hot dinners to elderly
shut-ins?
NORMA
Yes. Laura helped organize the
program.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw her?
NORMA
She came in around dinner time the
night before she died to pick up
her meals for delivery.
TRUMAN
Do you have the names of the people
on her route?
NORMA
I could get them for you.




COOPER
Would you please? And two more
pieces of that incredible pie.
Okay.

NORMA

She moves off. Truman looks at him.
TRUMAN
Man, you must have the metabolism
of a bumblebee.
The Log Lady is getting up to leave and leans in to them as
she passes...
LOG LADY
For your information, I heard you
speaking about Laura Palmer?
Yes?

COOPER

LOG LADY
One day my log will have something
to say about this. My Log saw
something that night.
She turns to leave.
COOPER
Wait a minute--what did it see?
She holds the log out.
Ask it.

LOG LADY

A moment of silence. They all look at the log.
LOG LADY (CONT'D)
I thought so.
The Log Lady exits.

Ronette is visible in b.g., lying on a bed in intensive care.
A STATE TROOPER stands guard in front of the entrance to the

MRS. PULASKI
That's right.
HAWK
And as far as you know, she went to

JANEK
Yes. At Horne's Department Store

HAWK
What did she do at the department
store?
MRS. PULASKI
She was a salesperson at the
perfume counter.
JANEK
She used to joke it was the bestsmelling job she ever had.
Mrs. Pulaski thinks of her daughter and gets a little tearyeyed. Hawk looks up and sees... ...the ONE-ARMED MAN looking

We hear a soft, cool be-bop tune. Lights are low. A pair of
strange, green orthopedic shoes dance expertly into view and
execute a few boss moves. We widen out to see Dr. Jacoby in
his fifties-style, Hawaiian-themed rec room. He picks up his
mail and sifts through it, continuing to dance. He stops
suddenly when he comes across a slightly bulky plain manilla
envelope. He opens the envelope and finds a single audio
cassette tape, without a case. Written on the cartridge are
the words...
"TO DR. JACOBY, WITH LOVE, LAURA"
Overcome with amazement, he instantly turns off his stereo,
punches eject, removes the tape that was playing, inserts
Laura's tape and hits play.
LAURA'S VOICE
(from tape)
Hey, what's up, doc? Ha-ha... it's
Thursday afternoon about four
o'clock and I'm so bored I'm making
you this tape on the pretty little
tape recorder you gave me...
We hear background noises on the tape; ambient sound from a
department store.




Dr. Jacoby nervously starts eating malted milkballs from a
bowl on his desk, cruching them in a single bite.
LAURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
...and as you probably already
noticed, I'm gonna mail it to you

you gave me... for, what was the
word you used? "confidentiality's
sake." ...this is kind of fun...
First, you're always bugging me to
tell you what my dreams are--let me
tell you about this one I had last
night: it was a doozy.
He reaches into his desk and takes out a pair of headphones,
which he puts on.
LAURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)

there was this little man and this
older man I'd never seen before
either, but they both seemed to
know me... there was music... and I

JERRY HORNE sits before a roaring fireplace, tumbler of
bourbon in hand, eating nuts compulsively from a giant bowl
while rapidly adding figures on a large computer while scores
of numbers flash up and down on the large computer monitor,
all the while talking into a headset phone receiver in a
melange of Icelandic and English.
In another part of the spacious room, the Horne family sits
quietly around the dinner table. AUDREY HORNE plays
listlessly with her food. A NURSE helps JOHNNY-still-wearinghis- headdress-HORNE eat, while MRS. HORNE stares at her full
plate. For no discernable reason, Johnny bursts into tears.
The Nurse comforts him and he starts to eat again. In spite
of her feigned indifference, a small, sad tear slips down
Audrey's cheek as she watches her brother.
BENJAMIN HORNE finishes carving up and chewing a big rare
steak and looks around at his family. He puts his napkin on
the table, rises, then smiles.
BENJAMIN
Always a pleasure.

Power down, Jer. We've got a

Jerry gets up, switches off the computer and does an Indian
dance towards and eventually around the dinner table, making
"traditional" Indian noises.

uniform, stands by, watching.

Permission to come ashore?
SWABBIE
Permission granted.
Jerry gives Swabbie a kiss. Benjamin follows Jerry out of the

Good evening, Mr. Horne.
Benjamin tips her a ten-spot and rubs her elbow.
SWABBIE (CONT'D)

A large sign of a playing card, a one-eyed jack, with neon
flashing "J's" and one pulsating eye, is suspended over two
identical doors. On one of the doors is a small neon sign
that reads, "CASINO." Ben and Jerry come up to the doors and
stop.
JERRY
Now, are we gonna go into the
casino first?

I'm not here to lose my shirt, I
just want to take it off.
Jerry rings a bell on the door without the sign. An
electronic buzz, a latch gives, and the door swings open.
CUT TO:
INT. ONE-EYED JACKS "LET'S GET ACQUAINTED" ROOM - NIGHT
Ben and Jerry enter a plush, cozy warmly lit room, easy
chairs, fluffy sofas and a small bar with a brass rail. Jerry
orders drinks from a scantily clad female BARTENDER.
JERRY
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two
drinks, one double scotch on the
rocks and my brother will have a
double scotch on the rocks.

BARTENDER
That's two double scotch on the
rocks?
JERRY
Next stop, rocket science.
Several of the establishment's sensational and extraordinary
WORKING GIRLS, known collectively as "The 52 Pick-Ups," enter
the room. They sit and luxuriously arrange themselves. Ben
and Jerry take note as they pick up their drinks. In sweeps
BLACKIE "THE BLACK ROSE" O'REILLY, the Madam of the House, an
intelligent, strikingly attractive woman in her midthirties.
BLACKIE
Gentlemen...
BENJAMIN
Blackie...
(he kisses her hand)
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's
day? Thou art more lovely and more
temperate: Rough winds do not shake
the darling buds of May, And
summer's lease hath all too short a
date: Sometimes too hot the eye of
heaven shines, And often is his
gold complexion dimm'd; And every
fair from fair sometimes declines,
By chance or nature's changing
course untrimm'd; But thy eternal
summer shall not fade, Nor lose
possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st
in his shade, When in eternal lines
to time thou grow'st; So long as
man can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long live this, and this gives
life to thee."
During above we register Blackie's reaction, detached
amusement, and Jerry's reaction, bored indifference. Several
more Pick-Ups wander in and we pay attention to their
reactions and those of the others already in the room, who
see Benjamin an ideal of worldly sophistication and power.
Benjamin finishes and kisses Blackie's hand again. Jerry
comes up to her and says quietly.
JERRY
Which one's the new girl?



BLACKIE
When you really want love... you
will find it waiting for you.
A curtain opens, revealing a gorgeous young WOMAN with the
face of an angel. Ben and Jerry look at each other, then
instantly back to the Woman. Jerry takes a coin out of his
pocket, flips it, and covers his wrist. Jerry and Ben look
down at the coin: heads. Ben smiles, pats his brother on the
back, and starts towards the Woman. Jerry slaps the coin down
on the bar.

Deeply saddened, Dr. Jacoby finishes listening to the tape,

James nods. A slightly awkward but not uncomfortable silence.
He tentatively reaches over for her hand, she takes it. They
hold hands and look at each other. He slowly pulls her
towards him into a sweet, tender kiss. They look at each
other. She smiles. They kiss again, very passionately.

JAMES
Donna, I don't feel that what we're

Because it's the truth. Because I
think it would have turned out this
way sooner or later anyway-DONNA
I don't know--you do?

Yes. I remember a time in school,
remember, in the hall, we were
suddenly alone and we looked at

I remember-JAMES
I almost told you I loved you then.
It's true.

CATHERINE

Nice fella. Asked a few questions.

Big band again, but fast, loud and brassy. He listens again.
This time it's the right stuff; tears spring into his eyes.

Truman reaches the spot on the rock with the tape and calls
back...
TRUMAN
Exactly sixty feet, six inches.
Perfect.

COOPER

Cooper bites into a doughnut. At the rock, Hawk whispers to
the Sheriff...



HAWK
What do you think he's up to?
Beats me.

TRUMAN

HAWK
Sixty feet, six inches; that's the
distance from home plate to the
pitcher's mound.
TRUMAN
Kinda interesting, huh?
Yeah.

HAWK

Truman starts back, re-spooling the tape measure. Andy shows
Cooper the bucket of rocks.
ANDY
Where would you like these rocks?
COOPER
Set 'em down by the donuts, Deputy.
Andy does. Lucy picks up a coffee pot.
LUCY
Would anyone like a warm-up?
EVERYONE
(severally)
Yes, please... thanks... you bet...
COOPER
Damn good coffee.
(sips, burns his tongue)
...and hot. Would everyone please
take a seat?
Truman, Hawk, Andy and Lucy sit on the four folding chairs.
Cooper takes a telescoping pointer out of his coat pocket and
expands it full length.
COOPER (CONT'D)
By way of explaining what we've
been doing and are about to do, I'm
going to first talk to you a little
bit about the country called Tibet.



Cooper flips the two-sided blackboard over, revealing a
detailed map of Tibet and surrounding countries tacked to the
back.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Tibet is bordered on the southeast
by Burma, on the south by India and
Nepal, on the west by India and
Kashmir and on the north and east
by China. It is almost completely
surrounded by mountain ranges. An
extremely spiritual country,
practicing a form of Buddhism known
as Tibetan Buddhism, for many
centuries the leader of Tibet has
been known as the Dalai Lama; upon
the death of each Dalai Lama, his
spirit is believed to pass into the
body of a newborn infant. An
exacting series of test are
performed to discover this boy's
identity, who is then rigorously
trained to fulfill his great
responsibilities.
The Sheriff's Department is intrigued, but completely
mystified.
COOPER (CONT'D)
In 1950, Communist China invaded
Tibet and while leaving the Dalai
Lama nominally in charge, they in
fact seized control of the entire
country. Following a Tibetan
uprising against the Chinese in
1959, the Dalai Lama was forced to
flee for his life to India, and has
lived in exile ever since.
Cooper collapses his expanding pointer.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Following a dream I had three years
ago, I have become deeply moved by
the plight of the Tibetan people,
and have been filled with a desire
to help them.
Cooper flips the blackboard back over. The Sheriff's
Department members look at each other just a tad uneasily.



COOPER (CONT'D)
I also awoke from this dream
realizing that I had subconsciously
gained knowledge of a certain
deductive technique, involving mindbody coordination operating hand-inhand with the deepest levels of
intuition. Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if
I could have your assistance I will
be happy to demonstrate this
technique...
Truman and Hawk look at the other, look at each other, and
stand. Cooper expands his pointer again.
COOPER (CONT'D)
You'll recall that on the day of
her death, Laura Palmer wrote in
her diary the following entry...
Points to where this line is written along the top left side
of the blackboard...
COOPER (CONT'D)
"Nervous about meeting "J."
tonight." Remember also that under
the nail on the ring finger of
Laura's left hand we discovered the
letter...
Points to where this is written on the top right side of the
blackboard.
COOPER (CONT'D)
"R." In addition, under the nail on
the ring finger of the left hand of
Theresa Banks, the girl who was
murdered last year, we discovered
the letter "T."
He writes the letter "T" next to the "R."
COOPER (CONT'D)
Today, however, we are going to
concentrate on the "J's." Harry, if
you would, when I give the word,
would you please read aloud each of
the names we've written on the
blackboard, all of whom had a
direct connection with Laura
Palmer.



TRUMAN
Okay... alright.
COOPER
Deputy Hawk, if you would hold this
bucket of rocks up near me where I
can get at them... and would you
please wear kitchen mittens.
HAWK
(looks at Truman, who
nods)
Yes, sir.
Hawk puts on a pair of kitchen mittens and picks up the
bucket of rocks.
COOPER
Deputy Andy, would you please move
down near the bottle and stand by-Andy rises and runs towards the distant rock, only too happy
to help.
COOPER (CONT'D)
(calling out)
Not too near!
Andy waves.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Lucy, would you please take the
chalk?
LUCY
(rises, takes the chalk
from Cooper)
I'm getting excited.
COOPER
And if I hit the bottle after
Sheriff Truman calls out a
particular name, make a check on
the board to the right of that name-Sheriff, I almost forgot, when you
say the name, also briefly
describe, if known, the person's
relationship to Laura Palmer-ready?
EVERYONE
(severally)
All set... yes... yep...



Ready!

ANDY

Cooper nods to Hawk, who holds up the bucket, then nods to
Truman.
TRUMAN
James Hurley...
(searches for a
description)
...secret boyfriend.
Cooper picks out a rock and holds it. He closes his eyes.
COOPER
James Hurley.
Cooper opens his eyes, winds up, and hurls the rock towards
the bottle. It strikes the larger rock well below the bottle.
Cooper nods at Truman.
TRUMAN
Josie Packard... was instructed in
English by Laura.
Cooper picks up a rock, closes his eyes.
COOPER
Josie Packard.
Cooper opens his eyes and lets it fly. It sails way above the
bottle, hits a tree and startles a bird that takes flight.
LUCY
So there's no check next to either
name?
COOPER
That's correct--next name, Sheriff.
TRUMAN
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby... Laura's
psychiatrist.
Cooper repeats the rock routine.
COOPER
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby.
Cooper throws again and hits the bottle. It falls off the
rock but doesn't break.



LUCY
You did it, you hit it.
Lucy writes a check next to Jacoby's name.
COOPER
Lucy, make a note that the bottle
was struck but did not break--very
important--Andy, put the bottle
back in exactly the same spot.
Lucy and Andy follow directions. Cooper nods to Truman.
TRUMAN
Johnny Horne... Laura was his
special education tutor.
COOPER
Johnny Horne.
He throws and clanks a fifty-gallon trash can, under a
Douglas Fir.
TRUMAN
Norma Jennings... owns diner,
helped Laura organize the Meals on
Wheels charity program.
COOPER
Norma Jennings.
He throws and misses.
TRUMAN
Shelly Johnson... waitress at
diner, friend.
COOPER
Shelly Johnson.
Cooper throws it again; it ricochets off the large rock,
shoots up and wings Andy in the loaf.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Andy, I'm sorry -Sweetie?

LUCY

ANDY
(immediately reassuring)
It didn't hurt, honest, it didn't
hurt a bit.



TRUMAN
Where there's no sense, there's no
feeling.
They all laugh, including Andy.
COOPER
Sheriff, please continue.
TRUMAN
Joey Paulson... friend of James,
drove Donna to meet him.
COOPER
Joey Paulson. C
ooper opens his eyes, takes aim, throws, and misses. Lucy
takes a loud sip of coffee. Cooper nods to Truman again, who
is slightly confused by the next name on the blackboard.
TRUMAN
(doesn't know who this is)
Jack with One Eye...
COOPER
Jack with One Eye...
LUCY
There's no "i" in Jack.
COOPER
I think perhaps it means he only
has one eye.
(covers an eye)
HAWK
Sounds like Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's
wife.
TRUMAN
No, there's a casino up north
called One-Eyed Jack's.
COOPER
That's it-TRUMAN
It's across the border on the
Canadian side.
COOPER
Sheriff, we're gonna have to check
that place out.



TRUMAN
Sure, sure-LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase
this because it's a place, not a
person-COOPER
Fine. Next name.
TRUMAN
It's the last one, Leo Johnson...
husband of Shelly, drives a truck,
connection to Laura... unknown.
He throws the rock, hits the bottle and breaks it.
CUT TO:
INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
NORMA JENNINGS is on the phone back in the kitchen.
NORMA
Shelly? It's Norma.
SHELLY
(trying to sound normal)
Oh hi, Norma, I was just about to
call you -NORMA
Are you alright?
SHELLY
I'm fine, I'm fine, actually, I'm
not feeling to good, think I got a
touch of the flu-NORMA
Shelly, didn't you have the flu
last week?
SHELLY
Norma, I'm okay... I just... can't
come in today.
NORMA
I'm worried about you.



SHELLY
Thank you, Norma, I'll be fine, I
just need to rest.
NORMA
You want me to bring you anything?
SHELLY
No, no, I've got everything here I
need, but thanks anyway, I hope
you'll be okay down there. Heidi
should be able to work my shift,
she shouldn't mind too much, I know
she needs the money-NORMA
Shelly, don't worry about it, you
work on getting better-SHELLY
Norma, I know you always feel like
you have to drop by, but don't drop
by, I'm okay...
(she starts to get
tearful, hides it)
I'll see you later.
Shelly hangs up. Norma hangs up slowly and takes a sip from a
cup of coffee, thinking about Shelly. She turns to a small
television set on the counter behind her and turns up the
volume.
We MOVE in on the television screen in time to see...
CUT TO:
THE TELEVISION
CLOSE on the set, as lush MUSIC swells over a robin's egg
blue background and we hear...
ANNOUNCER

A beautiful, glowing white envelope is set down on the
background and a silk ribbon is effortlessly untied... a
folded white note is taken from the envelope...
ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

Violins soar as the note is opened and a scarlet red flowing
script writes out the program's title on the virgin white
paper...

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. "INVITATION TO LOVE" SET #1 - "NIGHT"
A fake-classy elegant generic living room-dining room. A
beautiful, naughty looking redhead, EMERALD, bursts into the
room, steaming. She paces, picks up a silver cigarette box,
takes out a smoke, taps it angrily on the box and fires it up
with a two pound acrylic-glass-sculpture lighter. She exhales
an exasperated burst of smoke.
A nice-good-looking-but-ineffectual young man, CHET, follows
her into the room, carrying a highball.



CHET
Emerald, please, listen to reason-EMERALD
Reason? Reason? There's no reason-CHET
Jared's your father-EMERALD
And Melanie's my sister!
CHET
And she's my wife!
(she smokes)
Your father loves you, poor Jared,
he's been out of the hospital less
than a week-EMERALD
Ha! He wasn't even sick.
CHET
Yes, but those pains were real. You
shouldn't have spoken that way to
Melanie, she was with him at the
hospital night and day, she was
exhausted when you spoke, she
didn't mean to hurt you-INTERCUT:
SHELLY
Sipping her coffee, watching the
show hypnotically.
CUT TO:
THE TELEVISION
As the show continues...
EMERALD
We'll see who's hurt... Chet,
you're a fool...
(she puts out her
cigarette in his drink)
And Melanie's a fool. And Jared's
the biggest fool of all.
MONTANA'S VOICE
(from offscreen)
So what does that make me?



They both look towards a pair of open French doors leading
out to a patio... standing there is MONTANA, a big insolent
tough guy in t-shirt and leather jacket, a cigarette hanging
off his lip.
CHET
(stunned)
Montana...
EMERALD
(pause; a sly smile)
...I knew you'd be back.
MUSIC swells. Chet sweats. Montana scowls. Emerald sneers.
The set fades to black.
CUT TO:
INT. ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - DAY
NADINE HURLEY watches, engrossed by the show on her
television...
ANNOUNCER
(from the TV set)
...INVITATION TO LOVE... will
return...
Commercial music in; Nadine, in workout gear, resumes
vigorously rowing on her rowing machine. Wearing an extremely
greasy gas station work shirt, his hands covered with
industrial strength grime, BIG ED HURLEY enters the front
door behind her, stops when he sees Nadine rowing away.
Ed tries to tiptoe around behind Nadine so she doesn't see
him and in doing so steps on a drape runner and a bag of
cotton balls laid out on the floor. He bends the drape
runner. Nadine stops rowing.
Ed!

NADINE

ED
Sorry, honey, I didn't see it thereNADINE
What are you doing?
ED
I popped a grease cartridge, needed
to change my shirt--



NADINE
You stepped on my drape runner-ED
Nadine, honey, it's right out here
in the middle of the floor-NADINE
You think that's an accident? I
laid it out there myself, I was up
all night working on that invention-I'm going to have the world's
first 100% quiet runner!
ED
I'm really sorry, Nadine-NADINE
And why aren't you cleaning up at
the Gas Farm?
ED
Ran out of cleaner, honey, Spanky
knocked it over chasing a hubcap-NADINE
Ed, you make me sick!
Ed nods and moves into the other room. Pumped up with rage,
Nadine re-grips the metal oars and pulls back on them; we
hear the screech of rending steel as the oars bend back like
willow sticks.
CUT TO:
NADINE'S TELEVISION
The soap continues; JARED, a distinguished looking character
of sixty, in smoking jacket and ascot, sits at a desk, tears
streaming down his face. He reaches out a shaking hand for...

A sudden, loud knock on the door
startles her. She switches off the

Who is it?

SHELLY (CONT'D)

BOBBY'S VOICE
Hey, baby, it's the big bad bobcat-SHELLY
Are you crazy? What are you doing
here?
BOBBY'S VOICE
I just passed Leo, starting to
diesel up in North Bend, the
coast's clear, we got at least
twenty minutes, let me in-SHELLY
Where's your car?
BOBBY'S VOICE
Parked in the woods, somebody might
see me out here and that'd be
worse.
She decides to partially open the door and speak to him,
keeping the bruised side of her face hidden.
SHELLY
Bobby, you can't come here like
this, we can't see each other for a
while-He tries to kiss her, putting his arms around her, she
stiffens up in pain and he sees the bruises on her face.
BOBBY
What the hell happened to you?
SHELLY
Leo Johnson happened to me.



BOBBY
That bastard!
SHELLY
I'm telling you, he's crazy, if he
finds out about us he'll kill you,
he'll kill us both-BOBBY
If he ever does this to you again,
I'll kill him.
(she gets a twinkle in her
eye)
I mean it.
They kiss tenderly.
SHELLY
Bobby, you gotta go.
BOBBY
You call me soon as you can.
SHELLY
Alright, I'll try.
BOBBY

Save it for me, baby.
Bobby moves off. Shelly closes the door.

Josie moves down the corridor and enters another door...
CUT TO:
INT. BLUE PINE LODGE OFFICE - DAY
Catherine's office. Leaving the door open, Josie moves behind
the desk. She searches for and finds a catch that releases a
latch...
...a false shelf of books hinge out from the wall, revealing
an old fashioned wall safe. Josie takes out the key that Pete
gave her and inserts it into the keyhole of the safe. She
manipulates the handle and opens the safe door.
Josie reaches into the safe and lifts out two sets of two
ledger books labeled: PACKARD SAWMILL, RECEIPTS; one set
labeled "1989" and the other "19"
Josie hears a car drive up and brakes squeal outside.
CATHERINE'S VOICE
I told you to put it in the car-Josie quickly puts the books back in the safe, closes the
safe, replaces the false bookshelf, and scurries out of the
room.
CUT TO:
INT. BLUE PINE LODGE CORRIDOR/OFFICE - DAY
Just as Josie enters the corridor, Catherine comes up the
stairs to the corridor. Josie hurries back into the office
and hides in the closet.
CATHERINE
(to herself as she enters
the office)
I told that knothead twice to put
it in the car.
Catherine moves to the desk, looking for something, which she
finds. Josie watches from the closet as Catherine remembers
something, picks up a phone, punches in a number on the autodialer and waits.
CATHERINE (CONT'D)
Ben, Catherine... where the hell
were you last night? I thought we
had a date... family crisis?

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
You want to see a family crisis,

She hangs up and exits. In the closet, waiting, Josie ponders
this information.

railing.

Hi.
Hi.

AUDREY

DONNA

Something in Audrey's look says she wants to talk to Donna.
DONNA (CONT'D)
I'll be right there, Dad.
DR. HAYWARD
We're going over to get a Softie
Freeze, you'll be joining us, won't
you?
DONNA
Dad, when I have ever missed a
Softie Freeze?
MRS. HAYWARD
Maybe Audrey would like to join us?
AUDREY
Do you all go for a Softie Freeze
every Sunday?
DR. HAYWARD
Every Sunday after church since
Donna was a little girl.
MRS. HAYWARD
We enjoy is so much. Hope you can
join us.
Mrs. Hayward drives down the ramp.



DR. HAYWARD
Nice to see you in church, Audrey.
Dr. Hayward follows his wife off.
AUDREY
(sincerely)
I wanted to come down cause of
Laura.
DONNA
What do you mean? I didn't think
you even liked her.
AUDREY
There were things about her I
didn't like, but she helped take
care of my brother. And I guess I
sort of loved her for that. That's
why I'm here.
DONNA
That's really nice of you.
AUDREY
I knew how close you were to her. I
wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
Thanks.

DONNA

Audrey nods, shyly, ready to move off.
AUDREY
You take care.
Donna starts to watch her go.
DONNA
(feeling Audrey's
loneliness)
Why don't you come with us for a
Softie Freeze?
AUDREY
I don't know...
Really.

DONNA

AUDREY
(touched)
Yeah?



DONNA
Sure, come on, they're really good.
Okay.

AUDREY

DONNA

COOPER
Harry, just so you know, Albert and
his team are the cream of the crop-TRUMAN
If they're working for you, I
wouldn't expect anything less.
COOPER
Albert's a forensics genius, but I
should warn you he's lacking in
some of the social niceties.



TRUMAN
Nobody's perfect.
COOPER
Isn't that the truth?
They turn a corner and come upon Albert and his team.
ALBERT
What the hell kind of a two-bit
operation are they running out of
this tree house, Agent Cooper?
COOPER
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.
ALBERT
I have seen some slipshod backwater
burgs in my time, but this place
takes the cake.
Truman gives an astonished look at Cooper, who gestures "see
what I mean?"
ALBERT (CONT'D)
What are you waiting for, paint to
dry? We've got work to do, damn it,
they're putting the girl in the
ground tomorrow, half the day's
wasted traveling out here to the
middle of nowhere-COOPER

Albert well)
Albert, I suggest you and the

TRUMAN
I'll have one of my men escort you

your men up to the crime site.
COOPER
(hands him a file)
Results from the pathologist's
autopsy.
ALBERT
(scans it scornfully)
Welcome to Amateur Hour.
(to his men)
Looks like an all-nighter.



They pick up their suitcases. Truman holds the door open for
them.
TRUMAN
(as Albert passes)
I hear you're good at what you do.
Correct.

ALBERT

TRUMAN
That's good, because normally if a
stranger came into my station
talking this kind of crap, he'd
walk out wearing his teeth for a
charm bracelet.
Albert and Truman look eye-to-eye. Albert blinks first, puts

She embraces him, hugs him alarmingly hard.
ED
Why's that?
She looks up at him, her eyes wide and bright.
NADINE
You don't know what you've done for
me.
ED
No, I don't.
NADINE
Ed, you big lug... when you tracked
all that grease in the house today,
you spilled some onto my cotton
balls, but instead of tossin' 'em

attractive girl.
BENJAMIN
("are we talking about the
same person?")
...Audrey?
COOPER
You must be very proud. Well, I'll
say goodnight. Nice to have met you
both.
BENJAMIN
Sleep well.
COOPER
I will. The bed is almost exactly
to the right degree of firmness.
He's gone. The brothers look at each other: "what is with
this guy?"
CUT TO:
EXT. WOODS/INT. CAR - NIGHT
Bobby Briggs and MIKE NELSON pull up in Bobby's car next to a
stand of trees. Bobby kills the engine but the headlights
remain on. They look out at the woods.
MIKE
I don't see him.
BOBBY
He'll be here. Come on, back me up.
Bobby pops the glove compartment. Mike takes a switchblade
out, pockets it. Bobby grabs a flashlight. They step out of
the car.
CUT TO:



EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Bobby and Mike walk slowly forward, Mike lagging a step or
two behind. They reach a particular tree with a large hollow
knot. Bobby reaches into the knot and pulls out a football.
MIKE
Is it there? It is in there?
Bobby kneels down and reaches into a slit cut across the top
of the hollow football. He pulls out a small packet of white
powder.
BOBBY
Not all of it.
LEO'S VOICE
Cash on delivery, Bobby.
They look up. LEO JOHNSON is standing between them and the
car, backlit by headlights, holding a shotgun.
BOBBY
(rises slowly)
Hey, Leo.
Hey.

MIKE

LEO
Toss it over here, quarterback.
BOBBY
It's empty.
He tosses the football to Leo.
LEO
Is that right? Weren't you supposed
to leave something in there for me?
BOBBY
That's what we wanted to talk to
you about, man.
LEO
Half down, half on delivery. That's
the deal.
BOBBY
You haven't delivered. We already
gave you half.
(holds up the drugs)
(MORE)


BOBBY (CONT'D)
This is less than you owe us for
that--where's the rest?

LEO
Where's the rest of the money?
MIKE
There's a problem.
Problem?

LEO

BOBBY
Laura had the other half in a safe
deposit box.
LEO
You think you got problems?
BOBBY
We can get it, Leo, soon as things
settle down.
LEO
(advancing)
You owe me ten grand.
BOBBY
(backing off)
Okay. So we won't take delivery
until we get it for you-LEO
Look at me--I look like a bank to
you?
BOBBY
Man, I can appreciate your concern,
but this thing with Laura, how'm I
supposed to anticipate a thing like
that?
LEO
Laura was a wild girl.
BOBBY
Tell me about it.
LEO
Maybe. Someday.
Leo's right next to Bobby, Mike behind him. Bobby and Mike
look at each other. Mike reaches into his pocket.



Without taking his eyes off Bobby, Leo slowly swivels the
shotgun around and trains it on Mike.
LEO (CONT'D)
Take your hand out of your pocket,
Mike.
Mike and Bobby look at each other. Bobby nods. Mike takes his
hand out.
BOBBY
What's your problem, Leo?
LEO
Problem? You want to know about
problems?
...Okay.

BOBBY

LEO
You go out on the road. You're
drivin'. Back and forth. Gone for
days. You get home and guess what?
What?

BOBBY

LEO
You find out your old lady's been
givin' it away.
Yeah?

BOBBY

LEO
Yeah. Steppin' out. In your own...
damn...
(loud whisper)
...bedroom...
Leo's eyes dart back and forth. Amphetamines. Bobby and Mike
look at each other.
LEO (CONT'D)
That's... a problem.
He cocks the gun.
BOBBY
I guess so. I guess it is. You know
who?



LEO
A man needs a clean house.
BOBBY
Sure... so do you know who?
LEO
I will take care of it.
BOBBY
Sure you will... and this other
thing, hell, we'll take care of
that, too, don't you worry about
that. We'll get that cash and we'll
square everything-LEO
Go out for a pass.
What?

BOBBY

LEO
Go out. Run. Run.
Bobby and Mike back away from him.
BOBBY
Leo, take it easy, okay?
Run!

LEO

Bobby and Mike turn and start jogging away from him, back
towards the car, picking up speed, glancing over their
shoulders.
Oh God...

MIKE

As he reaches the clearing where the car is parked, we hear a
primal scream from the woods behind him.
They turn as the scream dies away and they reach their car.
Something comes soaring up out of the woods and arcs down
towards them...
...the football thuds onto the hood of the car, scaring the
shit out of Mike and Bobby. They look at each other.
BOBBY
Let's get the hell out of here.



They jump into the car and speed off into the night.

ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Dale Cooper is undressing for bed. He sets his bedside travel
alarm clock, takes off his wristwatch and sets it down, picks
up his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, 1:18 a.m. Long day, turning
in. Albert and his team should have
something for us by morning. Run a
check for me on a Jerry Horne, Twin
Peaks businessman, Jerry with a
"j", h-o-r-n-e. Nothing specific.
Call it an instinct. Check that;
intuition. An instinct is when you
get hungry. Let's also get
background on a local psychiatrist,
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, and wants-andwarrants on a truck driver, Leo
Johnson, also local. The air here
is fresh and crisp as a cracker;
you don't sleep, you slumber. Good
night, Diane.
He turns off the recorder, sets it down. Picks up a roll of
dental floss and tears off a string.

Yes... yes, Madelaine, dear, we'd
appreciate it a great deal... the
funeral's at two o'clock...
alright, we'll look for you around
noon... thank you, dear... drive
safely.
Leland hangs up, turns to Sarah.



LELAND (CONT'D)
(gently)
Sarah?... Sarah?
Leland moves over to her and kneels down beside her, as she
turns towards him. During the following, he takes a pill from
a bottle, hands it to her, along with a glass of water.
LELAND (CONT'D)
Sarah, that was cousin Madelaine...
SARAH
(a little hazy)
...Donald's girl?
LELAND
That's right, niece Madelaine.
SARAH
...is she here?
LELAND
She's driving in, tomorrow. For the
service.
Oh.

SARAH

Silence. Sarah takes the pill, drinks.
SARAH (CONT'D)
I'm going to go downstairs for a
while.
Alright.

LELAND

A long pause before Sarah rises and slowly moves out of the
room. Leland fights back some tears. He takes a pill from the
bottle and swallows it.

Dale Cooper lies asleep in bed. We move in slowly on him...

INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



NOTE: FROM THIS POINT TO THE LAST SCENE IS DALE COOPER'S
DREAM
Sarah Palmer sits on a couch, eyes
half-closed, fighting off
memories...
INTERCUT:
SARAH'S MEMORY - TIME DISTORTED
She moves up the stairs, the morning of the discovery of the
murder. She calls out Laura's name. She looks in her room.
She moves down the hall and calls again.
Sarah shifts uneasily on the couch...
CUT TO:
INT. LAURA'S ROOM - SARAH'S POV - TIME DISTORTED
She enters Laura's room and looks one way, then another...
one way, then another...
Sarah opens her eyes in horror...
A FRIGHTENING MAN is crouched in the corner by the foot of
Laura's bed, clutching the brass rails. It's the same man
Sarah saw in her vision the previous day.
Sarah sits bolt upright and screams...
SARAH
LELAND! I SAW HIM! OH! OH!

Leland Palmer frantically dials the phone...
INTERCUT:
INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Andy is playing "TAPS" on the trumpet. Lucy is sitting in a
chair hitting a ball attached by a string to a paddle. The
phone on the table beside her rings. She answers.
LUCY
Hello, Lucy Moran's residence, this
is Lucy...
LELAND
Lucy, Lucy!



LUCY
Shh! Andy, shh! I'm trying to talk
on the telephone.
Andy stops playing.
LELAND
Lucy, this is Leland Palmer, I'm
trying to get in touch with the
Sheriff, Sheriff Truman, he's not
at home, can you tell me where he
is?
LUCY
You know, Mr. Palmer, I don't.
(puts hand over the phone,
shushes Andy, he stops
playing)
LELAND
Lucy, my wife has just remembered,
she believes she saw the killer,
this morning, in Laura's bedroom-LUCY
No--how is that possible?
LELAND
I don't know, but she thinks with
someone's help, she could draw the
face that she remembers.
LUCY
Actually, Tommy "The Hawk" Hill is
our police sketch artist, he's very
good, the pictures look just like
the people he's drawing-LELAND
Lucy, can you please get the
Sheriff and that Deputy over here
right away?
LUCY
Okay. You know, I've got an idea,
as soon as we hang up, I'm going to
try the Sheriff in his car, in his
cruiser, and tell him everything
you've told me-LELAND
Thank you, Lucy.



He hangs up, shaking his head. We stay with Lucy as she hangs
up and quickly punches in another number.
LUCY

That was Mr. Palmer, he told me
that he thinks his wife remembers
that this morning, possibly when
she was in her daughter's room that
she saw the-(leaving Andy hanging)

Lucy is on the phone.
LUCY
Isn't it funny, I had a feeling
you'd be in your cruiser--Sheriff,
Mrs. Palmer was in her daughter's
room this morning and she just
remembered that--are you sitting
down, of course you are, you're
driving--she remembered that she-saw--the--killer.
TRUMAN
You're kidding...
LUCY
And they want you and Hawk to go

to make a sketch-TRUMAN
I'll be right there--ten minutes.

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Agent Dale Cooper lies in bed, sleeping fitfully, troubled by
a dream.

FIGURE'S VOICE
Agent Dale Cooper, please... wake
him...
INTERCUT:
INT. COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Woken from his troubled sleep, Cooper answers the phone.
COOPER
(answers the bedside
phone)
Agent Cooper...
FIGURE'S VOICE
Were you sleeping?
COOPER
Yes, who is this?
FIGURE'S VOICE
It's a strange night. There's
something in the air, can you feel
it?
(silence)
You know about Theresa Banks, the
pretty girl they found last
year?...
COOPER
Yes, I know about Theresa...
FIGURE'S VOICE
I know the man who did her... I
know about the stitches, with the
red thread... and there's more that
I think you'd enjoy hearing... I'm
at the hospital now.



COOPER
I'm on my way.
He hangs up the phone, starts to get out of bed, and the
phone rings again.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Agent Cooper...
INTERCUT:
INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Lucy is on the phone, Andy is nearby, listening.
LUCY
Hi, Agent Cooper, it's Lucy from
work?
COOPER
Are you still at work, Lucy?...
LUCY
No, Andy and I are over at my
place, Andy was playing the trumpet
and we were getting ready for bed
and do you know what happened?
COOPER
No, tell me -(stay with Cooper; a long
answer)
Oh, oh, oh, uh-huh, okay, okay, I
understand... Lucy, tell the
Sheriff to get that sketch and meet
me at the hospital--I've just
received a phone call-Back on Cooper as he hangs up, picks up his tape recorder and
speaks into it as he starts to dress.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Diane, woken from a sound sleep at
the Great Northern Hotel, room 315,
it's 2:24 am. Received two phone
calls, back to back; the first from
a man unknown to me who had certain
confidential information regarding
the Theresa Banks murder. I'm on my
way to meet him now. At the same
time, Mrs. Palmer apparently
remembered or had a vision of the
killer.
(MORE)


COOPER (CONT'D)
The Sheriff is on his way to her
and will meet me afterwards. Diane,
when two separate events happen
simultaneously pertaining to the
same object of inquiry, we must
always pay strict attention.

CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Andy stands in the doorway. The One-Armed Man stands in the
shadows of the room. Cooper and Truman, carrying two police
sketches, join Andy.
ANDY
He's unarmed. He wants to see you
and he wants to see you in this
particular room.
Truman and Cooper turn towards the man.
ONE-ARMED MAN
Don't turn on the overheads. The
fluorescents don't work. I think a
transformer's bad.
COOPER
We know that.
ONE-ARMED MAN
Yes. Wasn't Laura Palmer here
earlier? "Through the darkness of
futures past, the magician longs to
see. One chance out between two
worlds... fire, walk with me"... We
lived among the people. I think you
say, convenience store. We lived
above it. I mean it like it is,
like is sounds... my name is Mike.
His name is Bob.
COOPER
You were in an elevator here.
ONE-ARMED MAN
I was looking for Bob. He sometimes
works among the infirm, the injured
of the species. I was watching, Mr.
Cooper, for over a year. Waiting
for Bob to come out again. I've
known of your interests in the
results of his endeavors...
(MORE)


ONE-ARMED MAN (CONT'D)
I too have been touched by the
devilish one. Tattoo on the left
shoulder... oh, but when I saw the
face of God, I was changed. I took
the entire arm off.

Truman and Cooper look at each other.
TRUMAN
We'd like to show you a police
sketch of Bob, for verification.
ONE-ARMED MAN
Of course.
(Truman holds up a bogus
sketch)
No, no, that's not Bob.
(Truman holds up the
correct sketch)
That is Bob.
TRUMAN
(to Cooper)
That's the man Mrs. Palmer
identified.
COOPER
Where is Bob?
ONE-ARMED MAN
He's here. Right here. He's
downstairs, in the basement.
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman enter the basement, guns drawn. KILLER BOB,
the frightening long-haired man, crouches over a circle of
candles on the far side of the room.
Bob's hand reaches in and sets down a half of a heart
necklace onto a pile of dirt in the center of the candles.
Truman and Cooper advance. Bob rises.
KILLER BOB
(strangely)
Hello. Welcome to the killer's
lair. Come down, I won't hurt you.
Come down... is Mike with you?
No.

COOPER



KILLER BOB
Oh, I so much wanted to sing with
him again. Mike? Mike, can you hear
me? "Heads up, tails up, running to
your scallywag Night falls, morning
calls, catch you with my Death
Bag."
TRUMAN
The letters? What were the letters
going to spell?
KILLER BOB
Robert. That's my proper name.
Theresa's was a "t."
COOPER
That's right.
Behind Cooper and Truman, unseen by them, Mike is coming up
behind them, a gun in his hand.
KILLER BOB
You may think I've gone insane. But
I promise, I will kill again!
MIKE
Ahh! Like Hell!!!
Mike runs up and fires his gun twice. Bob goes down, mortally
wounded. Mike clutches a pole and twists to the ground, in
agonizing sympathetic pain.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Bob... Bob, it hurts something
terrible... wait... wait till your
turn, Bob... oh Bob... wait till
your turn...
Mike dies. Truman takes his gun away. Cooper looks over at
the candles.
COOPER

A title card reads: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER



INT. RED-DRAPED ROOM - DAY
A large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped
room. A table and three easy chairs. Dale Cooper, twentyfive years older, sits in one of the chairs. A LITTLE MAN,
three and a half feet tall, in a red suit, stands with his
back to Cooper, shaking violently. A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
who looks exactly like Laura Palmer sits across from Cooper
in another easy chair.
The Little Man stops shaking, turns to Cooper and claps his
hands once.
LITTLE MAN
Let's rock!
The Little Man sits in a chair beside the beautiful woman.
The Little Man closes his eyes and rubs his hands slowly
together.
The Little Man holds hands with the Woman, they look at each
other, then look at Cooper, smiling enigmatically. The Little
Man rubs his hands slowly again; the shadow of a bird passes
above them.
Both the Little Man and the Woman's speech is oddly stilted.
We see sub-titles under them, with the correct words.
Throughout, Cooper sits still, watches, and listens.
LITTLE MAN (CONT'D)
I've got good news! That gum you
like is going to come back in
style. She's my cousin, but doesn't
she look almost exactly like Laura
Palmer?
COOPER
But it is Laura Palmer. Are you
Laura Palmer?
WOMAN
I feel like I know her, but
sometimes my arms bend back.
LITTLE MAN
She's filled with secrets. Where
we're from, the birds sing a pretty
song and there's always music in
the air.
Strange saxophone music filters into the air. The Little Man
hops off the chair and begins to dance a strange dance around
the table.



The Woman rises, goes over, and gently kisses Cooper on the
mouth. She softly whispers something in his ear.
CUT TO:
INT. COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Cooper shoots up out of his bed, waking from this strange and
disturbing dream. He fumbles for the phone and dials.
COOPER
Harry, it's Cooper, meet me for

Palmer.
He hangs up.

EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
Morning breaks over the stately hotel.
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
DALE COOPER, at the corner table, takes a sip of coffee and
orders breakfast from waitress TRUDY.
COOPER
Shortstack of griddlecakes, maple
syrup, lightly heated and a slice
of ham. Nothing beats the taste of
maple syrup when it collides with
ham.
TRUDY
Griddlecakes, side a' ham. Warmup?
Cooper nods appreciatively. Trudy refills his cup, exits.
Cooper takes a sip, nearly hums with approval. Then looks up
to find AUDREY HORNE standing before him. Audrey smiles,
beautiful, rubs a little sleep out of her eyes.
AUDREY
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.
COOPER
Just Agent, Audrey. Special Agent.
AUDREY
(caressing the words)
Special Agent.
COOPER
Please. Sit down.
AUDREY
(unsure)
I'm in a hurry.
For what?

COOPER

She doesn't know what to say or do. So she offers a nervous
shrug instead.



COOPER (CONT'D)
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing
is incredible.
AUDREY
Do you really think so?
Cooper takes a pen from his pocket, hands it to her with a
napkin.
COOPER
Write your name down for me.
AUDREY
(eager)
Okay.
She takes the pen and writes carefully, hands it back to
Cooper. He looks at it.
COOPER
Audrey, there's something you'd
like to tell me.
AUDREY
(blushing)
There is?
Beat. All she wants is to be close to him. Cooper produces a
note from his pocket.
COOPER
You slipped this under my door
night before last.
I did?

AUDREY

Cooper nods. Audrey comes clean.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
I wanted to help you. For Laura.
COOPER
Were you and Laura friends?

No.

AUDREY
(simply)

(beat)
But I understand her. Better than
the rest.



COOPER
What is "One-Eyed Jack's?"
AUDREY
It's a place up north. Men go
there.
COOPER
What about women?
AUDREY
(blushing again)
Women work there.
COOPER
Did Laura work there?
AUDREY
I don't know. Laura worked at my
father's department store.
"Horne's?"

COOPER

AUDREY
He named it after himself.
COOPER
(on to something)
Where at Horne's department store?
AUDREY
(she thinks)
At the perfume counter.
COOPER
(making the connection)
So did Ronette Pulaski.
AUDREY
(it must mean something)
Really?
Cooper looks up, sees SHERIFF TRUMAN and LUCY MORAN coming
towards him from the far end of the dining room. Cooper looks
at Audrey's writing.
COOPER
The right-ward slant in your
handwriting indicates a romantic
nature, Audrey. A heart that
yearns. Be careful.



AUDREY
(a whisper)
I do?
COOPER
I'm going to have to ask you to
leave now.
AUDREY
(sees the Sheriff,
flustered)
Police business.
Cooper nods, winks. Audrey blushes, rises.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
Thank you for talking to me.
She leaves as Truman and Lucy reach the table, eager to hear
Cooper's news: the identity of Laura's killer. The Waitress
arrives with Cooper's breakfast.
COOPER
Two more coffees please.
(re: Audrey as she exits)
Pretty girl.
(back to Truman and Lucy)
Hungry? The griddlecakes are
outstanding.
TRUMAN
(sits; hushed, urgent)
Who killed Laura Palmer?
Truman and Lucy lean in, the suspense is killing them. Trudy
pours coffee for them, as Cooper takes a bite of griddlecake,
then, finally:
COOPER
Let me tell you about the dream I
had last night.
Truman nods at Lucy. She whips our a steno, pad and pencil.
Tibet?

TRUMAN

COOPER
No. You were there, Harry. And so
were you, Lucy. Do you have a
sketch artist?



TRUMAN
Andy sketches from time to time.
COOPER
Interesting. I dreamed it was
Deputy Hawk. Find out if Sarah
Palmer has had any disturbing
dreams. If she has, there may be
important clues in her dreams as
well.
Clues.

TRUMAN

COOPER
My dream is a code waiting to be
broken. Break the code, solve the
crime.
LUCY
(writing, whispering)
Break the code, solve the crime.
COOPER
In my dream, Sarah Palmer saw her
daughter's killer crouched at the
foot of her bed. Hawk sketched a
picture of the killer. I got a
phone call from a one-armed man
named Mike. The killer's name was
Bob.
TRUMAN
Bob and Mike?
COOPER
Different Bob. Different Mike. They
lived above a convenience store.
Mike couldn't stand the killing any
longer so he cut off his own arm.
Bob vowed he would kill again. So
Mike shot him.
(takes another bite)
Do you know where dreams come from,
Harry?
TRUMAN
Not specifically.



COOPER
(very happy)
Acetylcholine neurons fire high,
voltage impulses into the
forebrain. The impulses become
pictures, the pictures become your
dream. But no one knows why we
choose these particular pictures.
TRUMAN
Was that the end of your dream?
COOPER
(back to business)
Suddenly it was twenty-five years
later. I was old, sitting in a red
room. There was a midget in a red
suit and a beautiful young woman
who looked exactly like Laura
Palmer. The little man told me my
favorite gum was coming back in
style and didn't his cousin look
exactly like Laura Palmer?
TRUMAN
Which cousin?
COOPER
The beautiful girl. Sometimes her
arms bend back. She's filled with
secrets. Where they're from birds
sing a pretty song and there's
always music in the air. Then the
midget did a dance. Laura kissed me
on the mouth. And whispered the
killer's name in my ear.
TRUMAN
Who was it?
COOPER
I don't remember.
Damn.

TRUMAN

COOPER
Harry, our job is simple: break the
code, solve the crime.
Cooper finishes his pancakes.



LUCY
(still fascinated)
What does the midget stand for?
COOPER
Just about everything, Lucy.
Just then: Sheriff Truman's walky-talky shrieks. He answers
it.
TRUMAN
Yeah... Uh-huh... Right away.
(turns it off)
That was Andy. There's a fight at
the morgue.
COOPER

Albert.

INT. THE DOUBLE "R" DINER - DAY
NORMA JENNINGS and PAROLE OFFICER WILSON MOONEY occupy a
booth in the back. Mooney sips coffee, notes Norma's good
looks with a roving eye. In mid-conversation:
MOONEY
...in short, your husband has been
a model prisoner, an inspiration to
guard and inmate alike. He greets
the day with a smile and confounds
adversity with a kind word. He's a
credit to his serial number.
Mooney says it with a little come-hither grin. Norma just
stares, takes a drag off her cigarette, ignores him. Mooney
is forced to continue:
MOONEY (CONT'D)
Hank's parole hearing is scheduled
for Wednesday. Barring unforeseen
circumstance, with your full
support before the board, he should
be released shortly thereafter. Any
questions?



NORMA

No.
Comments?

No.

MOONEY

NORMA
(biting her tongue)

MOONEY
I'm sure Hank appreciates your
unwavering devotion.
(to file)
Now, I'll need to check some
information. You and Hank have been
married for...
NORMA
Since high school.
MOONEY
There are no children.
NORMA
I can't have any.
MOONEY
How would you characterize your
current relationship?
NORMA
What do you mean, Mr. Mooney?
MOONEY
Are you planning a divorce, Mrs.
Jennings?
NORMA
Not a divorce, no.
Mooney hears the qualification.
MOONEY
Will you help Hank find the job he
needs to effect a successful
parole?
Yes.

NORMA

MOONEY
How, exactly



NORMA
I own the Double "R", Mr. Mooney.
A beat. Norma can't stand him and Mooney knows it. Still, he
presses on:
MOONEY
You're quite a girl, Norma. You
must get all kinds of Romeos in
here begging for favors. How do you
keep them from your door?
It's his last attempt. Norma knocks it out of the ballpark:
NORMA
I usually tell them my homicidally
jealous husband is doing three-tofive for manslaughter but expects
to become a productive member of
society real soon.
MOONEY
(all business)
Well. That should conclude our
session for today.
Thank you.

NORMA

MOONEY
No, no. Thank you, Mrs. Jennings-Too late. Norma's already out of
the booth, stepping back to the
counter. Mooney picks up his file,
watches her leave him.
ANGLE ON COUNTER
A pale and wan SHELLY JOHNSON, newly arrived, sets her purse
beneath the cash register.
NORMA
I didn't expect you till after the
funeral.
SHELLY
I figured you could use some help.
Norma pauses, looks beneath the register. She can SEE
Shelly's purse, slightly open. And she can see a brand new
handgun inside it.



NORMA
(lowers her voice)
Shelly, what're you doing with a
gun in your purse?
Nothin'.

SHELLY

NORMA
"Nothin'." Nobody does "nothin'"
with a gun.
SHELLY
I bought it. It's for protection.
Peace of mind, anyway. You know,
what happened to Laura.
NORMA
You'd be better off hiring a

SHELLY
I can't afford one.
NORMA
Well watch yourself. Understand?
Shelly nods, pouts. Norma cases up a little.
NORMA (CONT'D)
Careful you don't murder your
makeup.
Norma grins, slips off toward hungry customers.
CUT TO:
INT. TWIN PEAKS MORGUE - DAY
SUDDENLY we are inside the Twin Peaks morgue in the midst of
a reeling argument. DOC HAYWARD squares off opposite ALBERT
ROSENFIELD, the impossibly rude pathologist. DEPUTY ANDY
BRENNAN stands to the side, mute, ineffectual. And BEN HORNE
physically separates the two men.
A white partition separates the men from the body of Laura
Palmer.
HAYWARD
I have never in my life met a man
with so little regard for human
frailty. Have you no compassion?!



ALBERT
I've got compassion running out of
my nose, pal. I'm the Sultan of
Sentiment!
Horne pushes them apart. Hayward and Albert pause, red with
fury. Finally:
ALBERT (CONT'D)
"Doctor" Hayward--and I use the
term so loosely my gums are
flapping--I have traveled thousands
of miles, and apparently several
centuries to this forgotten
sinkhole in order to perform a
series of tests. I do not ask you
to understand them. I am not a
cruel man. I only ask you to get
the hell out of my way so I can
finish my work!!
HAYWARD
We are here to escort Laura
Palmer's body to the cemetery. If
you think, for one minute, that we
will leave here without her, you
are out of-HORNE
All right all right all right. Dr.
Rosenfield. Please. You are not
dealing with the unsophisticated
here.
Albert rolls his eyes so hard they, nearly spin out of the
sockets.
HORNE (CONT'D)
(the high road)
Leland Palmer could not be with us
today. I have agreed to appear on
his behalf. And I know I speak for
all of us, the Palmer family
included, when I say that we
understand and appreciate the value
of your work. But, as their
representative, I must insist we
consider the feelings of the Palmer
family as well.
Deputy Andy clears his throat, figures he might assist:



ANDY
Dr. Rosenferd, we just got to get
Laura's body to the funeral on
time.
Albert glares.
ALBERT
Did you speak?!
Andy wishes he was invisible. Albert turns calmly back to
Horne.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
Mr. Horne. I realize that your
position in this fair community
pretty well guarantees venality,
insincerity and a rather irritating
method of expressing yourself.
Stupidity, however, is not a
necessarily inherent trait, so
please listen carefully. You can
have a funeral any old time. Dig
hole, plant coffin. I, however,
cannot perform these tests next
year, next month, next week, or
tomorrow! I must perform them now.
So please, why don't you and the
rest of the Bumpkin Brigade return
to porch rockers and resume
whittling. I've got a lot of
cutting and pasting to do-HAYWARD
That does it. I'm taking charge of
the body, you won't touch Laura
again from this moment on-Hayward steps toward the partition, Albert grabs him by the
arm.
ALBERT
Nor so fast, Old-Timer-They square off, ready to fight again. Horne tries pull them
apart. And, just in time, Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman
step into the morgue, the fray.
Gentlemen.

COOPER

HAYWARD
Harry, thank God--



ALBERT
Cooper, this mindless old fool is
obstructing a criminal
investigation. Cuff him.
HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for
the funeral, he's not human.
ALBERT
Certainly has a way with an insult
though.
TRUMAN
Hey that's enough.
ALBERT
Zip it, Squarejaw.
(to Cooper)
I do not suffer fools gladly. Fools
with badges, never. I want no
contact with this hulking boob-TRUMAN
I've had about enough of your
insults.
Albert steps forward, grabs him by the lapels.
ALBERT
Oh yeah? Well I've had about enough
of morons and half-wits, cretins
and congenital idiots, dolts,
dunces, dullards, and dumbbells.
And you, Chowderhead, lummox with
badge and billy club, you, Sheriff
Yokel you blithering hayseed, you
have had enough of me!??
TRUMAN
(calm as ice)
Yes I have.
Truman levels Albert with a single punch to the jaw. Albert
tumbles backward onto his butt. A beat. Albert looks up at
Truman, shocked beyond measure. Cooper intervenes in a flash.
He turns to Truman, orders:
COOPER
Harry, wait in the car.
Truman starts to speak, sees the steel in Cooper's eyes. He
exits without a word.



ALBERT
Oh well. That's nice. How
appropriate.
(gets to his feet, yells
after Truman)
The rustic sucker punch. Why not
gunplay? A hail of bullets would be
nice-COOPER
That's enough. The Sheriff didn't
mean anything.
He hit me.

ALBERT

COOPER
Well. I'm sure he meant to do that.
Albert starts to rail, but Cooper shuts him up with a
gesture.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Albert, I want the girl's body
released to her family now. I want
to see your test results by noon.
Those are orders.
Albert weighs his options, nods assent, marches off. A tense
beat. Ben Horne clears his throat. Doc Hayward turns to
Cooper.
HAYWARD
Thank you, Agent Cooper.
Cooper nods. Hayward, Horne, and Andy follow Albert out of
the room. A beat. Cooper remains, looks at the white
partition. He steps toward it.
ANGLE ON PARTITION
Agent Cooper pauses for a moment. stares quietly at Laura
Palmer's body. HOLD ON Cooper. The sadness in his eyes.
FADE OUT:
END ACT ONE



ACT TWO
FADE IN:
EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
Truman and Cooper pull up to the Johnson house, park the
cruiser next to Leo's truck rig. They step out of the
cruiser. Truman stops, deeply troubled about the morgue
altercation.
TRUMAN
I can't believe I decked him. It
was out of line, it was
unprofessional, it was probably
illegal.
COOPER
Harry, there are many ways to
handle an insult. But sometimes
there's just no substitute for a
stiff right hook.
TRUMAN
Tell me I'm not going to get my
butt kicked by the Bureau.
COOPER
Albert's been hit before. He will
be hit again. You'll get your
buttkicked over my dead body.
(takes a deep breath,
enjoys)
Look at that, there's a duck on the
lake. Fill me in on Leo Johnson.
TRUMAN
Leo's one of those guys you keep on
your list and you keep an eye on,
but we've never caught him with his
hand in the cookie jar.
They turn a corner and come upon LEO JOHNSON, behind the
house, chopping wood. Leo glances at them, continues to chop
wood furiously. They advance.
COOPER
Excuse me. Leo Johnson?
LEO
Who the hell are you?



TRUMAN
This is Special Agent Cooper of the
FBI, Leo. He'd like to ask you a
couple questions.
So?
So behave.

LEO
TRUMAN

Leo stops chopping, glares at Truman. But he just returns it.
Leo mutters, resumes chopping.
So ask.

LEO

COOPER
Leo. Is that short for Leonard?
LEO
That's a question?
COOPER
Did you know Laura Palmer?
No.

LEO

COOPER
How well did you know her?
LEO
I said I didn't.
COOPER
You're lying.
LEO
I knew who she was, all right?
Everybody did.
COOPER
Do you have a criminal record, Leo?
LEO
Nothing. You can look it up.
COOPER
(he already did)
A speeding ticket. April, 19 A
second moving violation, illegal Uturn. September, 1988--



LEO
I paid my debt to society.
COOPER
(beat)
Where were you the night of Laura
Palmer's murder? Around midnight.
LEO
(pleased with his alibi)
On the road. I called my wife
Shelly about that time. From Butte.
COOPER
She'll confirm that?
LEO
She will if you ask her.
Leo suddenly stops chopping, sticks the axe deep into the
wood. He looks at Cooper and Truman, unafraid. Cooper and
Truman look at each other.
CUT TO:
"INVITATION TO LOVE" - "NIGHT"
START CLOSE on a television screen, lush MUSIC over a robin's
egg blue background, the familiar voice intoning:
ANNOUNCER
...and every hour holds the promise
of an... INVITATION TO LOVE...
FADE UP ON insolent tough guy MONTANA in t-shirt and leather
jacket. Luscious EMERALD eyeing him like a cool drink of
water. And ineffectual CHET.
EMERALD
So, Montana, did you find that
rainbow you were looking for?
MONTANA
Lots of rainbows. No pot of gold.
CHET
I'm not sure how I'm feeling about
this.
EMERALD
Chet, get Montana a drink. He must be thirsty after a year in
the rain forest.



Emerald sashays across the living room, steps lightly into
Montana's arms. She offers him a welcome kiss--a little too
ardently for Chet's liking.
CHET
How long are you planning to stay,
Montana?
Montana looks up from Emerald's beestung lips.
MONTANA
Long enough to see my ex-wife; how
is Jade, Chet?
Chet shivers. The music swells.
CUT TO:
INT. PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a television in the Palmer house. A
NURSE turns her eyes from the screen, withdraws a syringe
from Leland Palmer's arm. She discards the empty, carefully
draws medication into a second syringe, and places it on a
tray. Just then: the doorbell RINGS.
STAY WITH Leland as the nurse walks to the front door. Leland
watches television.
INTERCUT:
"INVITATION TO LOVE"
JARED, distinguished in smoking jacket and ascot, weeps,
finishes a suicide note addressed to Emerald and Jade. He
takes a gun into his hands, lifts it slowly. Suddenly:
someone knocks at the door, calls to him.
JADE'S VOICE
Daddy! Open up! Daddy it's jade!
Jared pauses, looks at the door, the gun. Music swells.
DURING ABOVE, we HEAR the Palmer's front door open, some
muted exchange, two sets of footsteps returning to the living
room. Finally:
MADELEINE'S VOICE
Uncle Leland?
Leland looks up, sees the Nurse and MADELEINE FERGUSON
standing before him. Madeleine is twenty, quite beautiful,
She wear glasses, has jet black hair worn long.



She sets down a suitcase. A closer angle REVEALS that she
looks very much like Laura Palmer.
Leland stares at Madeleine for a long beat. As if he didn't
recognize her. Then, with great difficulty:
LELAND
Madelaine?
(rises, steps closer,
takes her by the hands)
Maddy?
MADELEINE
Uncle Leland, I'm so sorry, I...
Madeleine pauses, a sob catches in her throat. She begins to
cry. Leland carefully wipes a tear from her deep blue eyes.
Madeleine looks up at him, whispers:
MADELEINE (CONT'D)
Oh Uncle Leland...
Leland takes her into a healing embrace. He's crying too.
HOLD ON them for a beat.
CUT TO:
"INVITATION TO LOVE" - "NIGHT"
Jared holds the gun in his hands, listens to his daughter's
tearful pleading.
JADE
Daddy! Daddy please!
Finally, Jared sets the gun on his desk, steps to the door.
He opens it. And JADE, his beautiful, compassionate, perfect
daughter leaps into his arms. She is Emerald's twin.
JADE (CONT'D)
Oh Daddy. I was so afraid. I love
you Daddy.
HOLD on father and daughter for a beat.

INT. HAYWARD HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Doc Hayward steps into the living room, dressed for the
funeral save for the tie which hangs undone around his neck.
Donna waits for him. She looks at his tie, manages a small
smile.
DONNA
Dad, you're hopeless.
Donna knots her father's tie. She does not speak. Her eyes
are red from crying. Hayward takes a look at his daughter,
consoles:
HAYWARD
Want to talk about it?
DONNA
Oh, Dad, I... I can't believe
they're burying Laura today. It's
so... final. I think and I think
and it just doesn't make sense.
HAYWARD
Death never does.
DONNA
(tearful)
So what are we supposed to do?
HAYWARD
(after a beat)
I live with death and dying every
day. There are times when it's
merciful, almost a relief. But
often it seems nothing but needless
and cruel. It made me furious, for
many years. Furious and helpless.
As you go through life, you learn
to accept it. Because we have to.
Even when it hurts bad enough to
break your heart.
DONNA
My heart is breaking. And I don't
know how to stop it.
Donna looks up at her father. Her eyes are bright with tears.
Father and daughter embrace.

EXT. BRIGGS HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO:
INT. BRIGGS DINING ROOM - DAY
BOBBY BRIGGS sits at the dining room table, smoking a
cigarette. Quiet, seemingly downcast. But his eyes are angry
and cold. He wears dark funeral clothes, a tie. Bobby turns,
finds MAJOR BRIGGS standing across the room.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert, this may be a good time for
a brief discussion.
BOBBY
You want to talk about cigarettes?
Today?
MAJOR BRIGGS
No. But put it out. It's a filthy
habit, especially for a varsity
athlete.
Bobby grinds out the cigarette in an ashtray. He glowers.
Major Briggs sits next to him, places a hand on Bobby's knee.
He means well, but physical affection does not come naturally
to him. It feels a little forced.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
I've attended my share of funerals.
Too many. Any man who dies in war
dies too soon. Laura died too soon
as well.
BOBBY
Yeah. She did.
MAJOR BRIGGS
But we have a responsibility to the
dead, Robert. Responsibility is the
linchpin that binds our society
together. Each man responsible for
his actions, each action
contributing to the greater good.
BOBBY
What's the good of putting somebody
in the ground?



MAJOR BRIGGS
It is man's way of achieving
closure. In ceremony begins
understanding, and the will to
carry on without those we must
leave behind. And Robert, in your
life, you must learn, will learn,
to carry on without them.
BOBBY
(whispered)
Great.
MAJOR BRIGGS
I know you experience a certain
reluctance to enter fully into
meaningful exchange. That leads to
stalemate, and a desire on my part
to force certain wisdom upon you.
That's not necessarily a bad thing,
sometimes it is the best course
available.
Briggs pauses, rethinks. Then, a direct emotional
statement...
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Son. Don't be afraid. We'll all be
there together.
Bobby takes a closer look at his father. These are words he
understands. But they have absolutely nothing to do with the
way he's feeling.
BOBBY
Afraid of what?
MAJOR BRIGGS
The funeral.
BOBBY
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.
Afraid? I can hardly wait. Afraid?
I'm gonna turn it upside--down.
The anger pours out of him. For once Major Briggs is
speechless. But no matter, just then BETTY BRIGGS steps into
the room, and, with a too bright smile...
BETTY
Everybody ready?



Father and son turn jaundiced eyes her way.

INT. POLICE STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Cooper and Sheriff Truman step through the station reception
area. DEPUTY TOMMY THE HAWK appears, keeps pace beside them.
COOPER
Deputy Hawk.
HAWK
Agent Cooper. No sign of the man

COOPER
Keep trying, Deputy. He's out there

Cooper and Truman continue towards the conference room.
TRUMAN
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.
Tracker?
The best.

COOPER
TRUMAN
CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY
Cooper and Truman enter. Albert Rosenfield sits at the table,
with a huge file of test results. He refuses to acknowledge
Truman's presence. Not even a glare.
COOPER
Okay, Albert, what've you got?
ALBERT
Enough evidence to save your butt
and get mine out of this
godforsaken berg.



COOPER
We're all ears.
Albert considers hurling an insult, instead tosses a glassine
envelope on the table.
ALBERT
Contents of envelope found in
Palmer diary. Cocaine. Toxicology
results also positive. The little
lady had a habit.
(throws a second envelope)
Fibers of twine embedded in her
wrists and upper arms. Two
different kinds of twine.
(another envelope)
Fibers of twine found in the
railroad car, a match to the sample
from the wrist. The same twine was
used to bind the wrists of the
Pulaski girl. My conclusion, she
was tied up twice at different
locations on the night of her
death. Once here.
(he points to his wrists)
Once here. Like this.
He gestures to his upper arms, pulls them back into an
uncomfortable position. Like in Cooper's dream.
COOPER
(quietly)
Sometimes my arms bend back.
Truman glances at him, intrigued. Albert reveals another
glassine.
ALBERT
Traces of pumice in standing water
outside the railroad car,
suggesting soap. The kind used for
heavy cleaning. Same pumice
particles appear on the back of
Laura's neck. Not her home-use
brand. My conclusion: the killer
washed his hands and leaned in for
a kiss... like this.
He demonstrates. Truman is disturbed by the implication.
Lord...

TRUMAN



Albert shows them a photo.
ALBERT
Distinctive wounds on Laura's
shoulders and neck. Appear to be
claw marks, bites of some kind.
An animal?

TRUMAN

ALBERT
It's trying to think. How quaint.
Cooper silences Albert with a stern look. Albert produces
another envelope.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
A small plastic fragment from her
stomach, partially dissolved by
digestive acids. I'm taking it with
me back to the lab for
reconstruction, as the local
facilities give new meaning to the
word 'primitive.'
(closes the file with some
fanfare)
Those are the highlights. I'm not
entirely displeased, but a couple
more days with the body and who
knows what I might have come up
with-COOPER
Good work, Albert.
Just then, Deputy Andy enters, dressed in funeral blues.
ANDY
Sheriff. Time to go?
COOPER
Albert, you'll excuse us. We've got
to get to a funeral.
Truman and Andy head out. Cooper moves to follow. But Albert
calls after him:
ALBERT
Cooper? May I have a word with you?
Alone?
Cooper nods to Truman and Andy. They exit. Albert pulls out a
document.



ALBERT (CONT'D)
One more item.
(he slides it across the
table)
A report concerning the physical
assault on my person which you
witnessed this morning. I think
you'll find it accurate. It
requires your signature.
Cooper reads through the report with amazing speed. A beat,
then:
COOPER
Albert, I'm not going to sign this-ALBERT
(shocked)
What?
COOPER
Albert, I hope you can hear this.
I've only been in Twin Peaks a
short time. But in that time, I
have seen decency, honor, and
dignity. I have seen grief to break
your heart. Murder is not a
faceless event here. It's not a
statistic to be tallied up at the
end of every day. Laura Palmer's
death has affected each and every
man, woman, and child. Because life
has meaning here. Every life. And
that's a way of living I thought
had vanished from this earth. It
hasn't, Albert. It's right here in
Twin Peaks.
ALBERT
Sounds like you've been snacking on
some of the local mushrooms.
Cooper sets the report on the table, carefully pushes it back
to Albert.
COOPER
With your behavior towards these
good people, count yourself lucky I
don't file a report of my own that
could bury you so deep in a
building in Washington you'll never
see the sun.



Albert turns pale, collects his papers, exits without another
word. Cooper looks out the window, produces his miniature
tape recorder, speaks into it.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Diane, it's 12:27 PM. I'd like you
to check into my pension plan
options regarding outside real
estate investment. I'm thinking of
purchasing some property at what I
assume will be a very reasonable
price.
Cooper stops recording, pauses to ponder.

ED HURLEY steps into the living room wearing an ill-fitting
dark suit. He takes but three strides before Nadine appears
in a flurry, leaps into his arms. She nearly knocks him off
his feet. Ed endures an embrace of lengthy duration, Nadine
snuffling about his ear. Finally, she steps back, beaming,
out of her mind:
Love me?

NADINE

ED
(wildly uncertain)
Why sure, Nadine.
NADINE
How do I look?
Nadine's wearing a faded black dress. Her idea of funeral
clothes. The buttons are incorrectly fastened. Ed looks at
the dress, Nadine's manic smile.
ED
You look fine, Nadine.



NADINE
Last night was wonderful, Ed. You
came back to me. Now we're together
again. Not that we weren't, but now
I feel like we're really together.
Nadine leaps back into his arms. Ed receives her with stunned
expression.
NADINE (CONT'D)
At high school, I used to watch
Norma and you at those football
games? She was so pretty. You were
such a handsome couple, but I knew,
I always knew once you got to know

though I was just a little nobody,
a little brown mouse, I was always
hoping... and wasn't I right?
Wasn't I right?
Nadine pauses, the memories come and go. She looks up at Ed,

jacket. Ed frowns.
ED (CONT'D)
You ready? I don't want to be late.



JAMES
I'm not going.
ED
What do you mean you're not going.
It's Laura.

AUDREY'S POV - INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
JOHNNIE HORNE sits on the floor, attired in an expensive
suit. DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY kneels at his feet, whispers

familiar Indian headdress.
Audrey watches from outside the doorway, listens to Jacoby
whisper and cajole. She can see tears glistening in the
doctor's eyes.
CUT TO:
EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY
A flowered trellis stands at the entrance from the parking
lot to the burial grounds. The LOG LADY arrives wearing a
surprisingly appropriate funeral dress, clutching her log to

She steps among mourners as they emerge from automobiles.
Cooper, Sheriff Truman, and Deputies Andy and Hawk get out of
the police cruiser, join the throng.

Mourners step through the trellis into the cemetery proper.
Doc Hayward escorts Donna onto the green grass, she pauses,
sees Mike waiting for her nearby.
Hi.

MIKE

DONNA

Just a sec.
Donna steps away from her father, walks to Mike. She looks at
him, says nothing. An awkward beat, then:
MIKE
Hey. I'm sorry about the other
night. I didn't mean anything.
(reaches for her, she
pulls away)
Hey, I said I was sorry...
DONNA
I don't want to see you anymore,
Mike. Please don't bother me again.
Mike watches, shellshocked, as she walks away.

Ed escorts Nadine through the cemetery. He sees Donna
returning to her father.
ED

Nadine seems uneasy, a little lost.

I promise. It'll be fine.
Nadine nods, reassured, moves off. Ed steps toward Donna,
intercepts.



ED (CONT'D)
Hello, Donna.
DONNA
Where's...?
ED
He's not coming. He wouldn't.
Why?

DONNA

Ed can only shrug. Donna sees her father waiting, there's no
rime to talk. She's upset, tries to hide it and walks on.
Ed?

NORMA'S VOICE

Ed turns, finds Norma standing behind him. She's troubled.
Hi.

NORMA

ED
(an uneasy glance around)
Not the best place to talk.
NORMA
I know. Hank's parole hearing is

week. Maybe sooner.
Ed nods. He doesn't want to talk about it here. She sees
Nadine standing nearby and realizes why.
NORMA (CONT'D)

Nadine looks nice.
ED
Yeah. She's feeling good today.
There's sympathy in his voice, sadness too. Norma
understands. Ed manages a smile and moves off.

Lastly, Ben Horne escorts Leland and SARAH PALMER into the
cemetery. Mourners stop and stare. Sarah squints in the
sunlight, clutches Leland's hand. And Madeleine Ferguson
walks behind them, wearing dark glasses.



Ben spots Catherine nearby. He nods to Madeleine, allows her
to escort Leland and Sarah ahead. Ben remains, waits for
Catherine to join him.
CATHERINE
(as they walk, aside)
Taking care of the Palmers, are we?
BEN
It's the only decent thing to do.
CATHERINE

See you at the funeral.
Ben and Catherine separate, poker-faced.
CUT TO:
EXT. LAURA'S GRAVESITE - DAY
Mourners gather around the grave. Laura's burnished casket
sits on its hydraulic bed, the dark hole beneath it. And
FATHER CLARENCE prepares his oration. Father Clarence is an
old man, red-faced; he fumbles with a number of prayer books
and hymnals. This is no ordinary service for him. He is as
deeply saddened as those who wait for him to comfort them.
FATHER CLARENCE
I am the resurrection and the life,
saith the Lord; he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live; and whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never
die.
In the distance, a lone figure steps through headstones
toward the grave. James Hurley. He walks closer, eyes locked
on Laura's casket. Bobby sees him coming, darkens, scowls.
Donna sees James too. She finds Bobby in the throng, notes
his fury. And so begins, as Father Clarence continues, a
CHAIN OF GLANCES.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
For none of us liveth to himself,
and no man dieth to himself. For if
we live, we live unto the Lord; and
if we die, we die unto the Lord.



Donna looks to Sheriff Truman for help.
But Sheriff Truman is looking at Josie.
Josie meets his gaze. Then looks away, as if too shy to stare
at him here.
Josie turns to Pete Martell. Pete nods, ever sociable.
CLARENCE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
(over glances)
Whether we live, therefore, or die,
we are the Lord's. Blessed are the
dead who die in the Lord; even so
saith the Spirit, for they rest
from their labors. The Lord be with
you...
ALL
And with thy spirit.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
Let us pray.
Pete turns from Josie, looks to his wife.
But Catherine is leering at Ben Horne.
Ben returns her gaze, but is jostled by Bobby shoving past
him toward the grave.
CLARENCE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
God, entrust this child Laura to
thy never-failing care and love,
and bring us all to thy heavenly
kingdom; through the same thy Son
Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth
and reigneth with thee and the Holy
Spirit, one God, now and forever.
Amen.
Father Clarence clears his throat. But before he can
continue, Johnny Home brays out a rather ill-timed:
Amen!

JOHNNY

FATHER CLARENCE
Thank you, Johnny.



THE CHAIN OF GLANCES CONTINUES:
Shelly spots Bobby, sees his anger, follows his stare to
James.
James is looking at Donna, seeking comfort, approval.
But Donna, having witnessed Bobby's fury, now looks to Big Ed
for help.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
I baptized Laura Palmer. I
instructed her in Sunday school.
And like all of you, I came to love
her with that special love we
reserve for the headstrong and
bold. Laura was bright, beautiful,
charming. But most of all she was,
I think, impatient. Impatient for
her life to begin, for the rest of
the world to catch up with her many
dreams and ambitions.
Big Ed doesn't notice Donna's distress. He's busy trying to
get Norma's attention.
Norma doesn't see him. She's looking at Nadine.
Nadine, oblivious as always, is gazing intently at Leland and
Sarah Palmer, Madeleine beside them. Nadine wipes tears from
her eye.
CLARENCE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
If we appear to put those dreams to
rest today, do not believe it. For
those of us who loved her, those
dreams will never die. They live on
inside each of us.
JOHNNY'S VOICE
(as ill-timed as before)
Amen!
Madeleine looks up, sees Nadine peering at her from across
the grave.
Madeleine looks away, only to find Audrey staring at her from
the other side.
Audrey notes the resemblance to Laura, reacts.
Audrey looks to find Agent Cooper in the throng, she wants
him to see it too.



And as for Cooper, he's been watching this chain from the
start, fascinated by all the connections and clues it offers
him.
Suddenly Cooper frowns. He sees Bobby Briggs plowing through
the crowd, stepping quickly toward Father Clarence, the
grave.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
Laura used to tell me that I talked
too much. I won't make that mistake
here. It is enough to say that I
loved her, and will miss her for
the rest of my days.
JOHNNYS VOICE
(getting into his own call
and response rhythm)
Amen!!
Bobby steps to the front of the gravesite, nearly howls the
repetition:
AMEN!!!

BOBBY

Everything stops. Bobby confronts the grave and the gathered
mourners with grief and rage.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
What are you looking at? What are
you waiting for? You make me sick.
You damn hypocrites make me sick.
Everybody knew she was in trouble.
But we didn't do a thing. Who
killed the Prom Queen?! You did. We
all did. And pretty words won't
bring her back. Keep your prayers.
Laura doesn't need them. She
would've laughed at them anyway
Bobby's cracking up, tears pool in his eyes. James moves to
stop him. Mike hurries forward, ready to fight. Bobby sees
James approaching, he leaps in his direction.
But Cooper gets there first, Truman, Andy, and Hawk close
behind. They pull the boys apart, stop the fight before it
happens. Amidst the shouting and commotion, Johnny Horne
lifts his head toward the sky, lets out an atavistic howl:
JOHNNY
Ahoooooooooooh!!



Audrey rushes to comfort him. The howl, the brawl, all
contribute to a growing sense of chaos, trouble and grief in
the air. Major Briggs grabs his son and drags him away from
the grave as Bobby screams at James:
BOBBY
I'll get you! You're dead! I'll get
you!
And now, unnoticed for the moment, Leland Palmer lets go of
his wife's hand, steps quietly toward the casket. He stares
at it for a long beat, the tumult erupting all around him.
Then, quite suddenly, without warning...
Leland Palmer leaps onto the casket, shouting and wailing...
LELAND
Laura! Laura!
Gasps of shock. Truman and Cooper step forward immediately,
but Leland's jump has activated the hydraulics, the casket
begins to sink from view. A CARETAKER frantically reverses
the controls, brings Leland and the casket up again. But just
as Truman and Cooper seem about to grab him, the casket
begins to descend, remains beyond their grasp.
LELAND (CONT'D)
Laura! My baby! And so it goes, the
casket rising and falling, Truman
and Cooper now enlisting the
deputies to form a human chain, the
mourners reacting with shock and
dismay. And now, at long last,
Sarah Palmer takes tentative steps
forward, her eyes seem to clear,
and she shouts, roars at her
husband:
SARAH
DON'T RUIN THIS TOO!!
A sudden silence descends upon the gravesite. Sarah Palmer
remains frozen, Madeleine at her side. Mourners glance at
each other, begin to disperse. The funeral of Laura Palmer
has concluded.

END ACT THREE



ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
EXT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Nightfall at the Double R.
CUT TO:
INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
OPEN ON a pair of hands, female, acting out a pantomime on
the Double R counter. One hand, palm down, held out straight,
suggests a coffin/platform. The other, two fingers pointed
down, skips across the counter, suggesting leaping feet. In
this manner, accompanied by buzzing lips approximating the
sound of hydraulics, Shelly Johnson reenacts the funeral
imbroglio. Her fingers skip across the counter, leap upon the
coffin, and BZZZZZ, the hydraulics go up and down and up and
down...
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Shelly in the Double R. She's
entertaining several old coots at the counter, demonstrating
Leland Palmer's leap onto the casket--and into local lore.
Norma passes by, frowns.
Shelly puts her hands behind her back as if to promise no
more finger puppets. But the moment Norma moves on, she's at
it again, fingers flying, lips buzzing, much to the delight
of the crusty old regulars.
CUT TO:
INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Sheriff Truman, Big Ed Hurley, and Deputy Hawk share a booth
in the back, drinking coffee and eating pie. They speak just
above a whisper. They're trading secrets, not funeral gossip.
In mid-conversation:
TRUMAN
Maybe we should tell him.
Why?

HAWK

TRUMAN
I feel bad keeping him in the dark.
What the hell, he's going to figure
it our sooner or later anyway.
ED
Don't be so sure.



TRUMAN
(looking over Ed's
shoulder)
Want to bet?
Truman SEES Cooper enter the diner, step toward their booth.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
Right on time.
ED
(sotto voce)
Careful who you trust, Harry. He's
not one of us.
COOPER
Evening, Harry. Ed, Hawk.
Truman gestures to the space beside him. Cooper sits down.
COOPER (CONT'D)
I got your note. What's up?
Ed signals to Norma, she steps over to take Cooper's order.
TRUMAN
Agent Cooper, how would you like
some fresh huckleberry pie?
COOPER
I would love some huckleberry pie.
(for Norma's benefit)
Heated. Vanilla ice cream on the
side. Coffee.
NORMA
Coming right up.
Norma steps away. Cooper turns to Ed.
COOPER
How long have you been in love with
Norma?
Ed blanches, says nothing. Truman turns to him.
TRUMAN
See what I mean?
Ed nods. Cooper takes note of the exchange, looks to Hawk,
Sheriff Truman.



COOPER
There's something you fellas want
to tell me.
ED
(a convert)
Better tell him.
Hawk nods assent. A beat. Sheriff Truman begins:
TRUMAN
Someone's running drugs into Twin
Peaks from over the border. We've
been working undercover, trying to
set up a bust: top to bottom.
Nobody walks.
COOPER
Who's targeted?
TRUMAN
Jacques Renault, bartender at the
Roadhouse, we figure him for the
middleman. Ed was staking him out
the night you got into town.
Renault slipped something into his
drink.
ED
Felt like somebody hit me on the
head with a hammer.
COOPER
I didn't know you were a deputy,
Ed.
He's not.

TRUMAN

COOPER
A little outside your jurisdiction,
isn't it?
ED
Somebody's sellin' drugs to high
school kids. That's in everybody's
jurisdiction.
TRUMAN
I call on Ed when I need him. He's
not the only one I call.
Just then: Norma arrives with Cooper's pie and coffee.



TRUMAN (CONT'D)
Thank you, Norma.
Enjoy.

NORMA

Cooper digs in, gives Norma a hearty thumbs-up. Norma smiles,
walks away.
COOPER
This must be where pies go when
they die.
Cooper takes another bite. Sheriff Truman waits for some
reaction to all he's told him. Finally, Cooper sets down his
fork, begins:
COOPER (CONT'D)
Someone's bringing, drugs into Twin
Peaks. Laura Palmer was on drugs.
You call on Ed to help you out.
Ed's a good man. Local bartender's
a mid- level player, okay, it's
hard to get by on minimum wage. Now
Harry, please. What is it you
really want to tell me?
Sheriff Truman looks at the others. They encourage him to
continue
TRUMAN
You're going to have to trust me.
No matter how it sounds.
COOPER
I trust you, Harry.
TRUMAN
(after a beat, looking for
words)
Twin Peaks is different. A long way
from the world. You've noticed
that.
COOPER
Indeed I have.
TRUMAN
And that's the way we like it. But
there's a back end to that that's
different too. Maybe that's the
price we pay for all the good
things.



COOPER
What is it?
TRUMAN
(lowering his voice)
There's a sort of evil out there.
Something strange in the hills. It
takes different forms, but it's
been there for as long as anyone
can remember. And we've always been
here to fight it.
"We?"

COOPER

TRUMAN
Men before us. Men before them.
More after we're gone. We protect
our own. We have to.
COOPER
(relishing this)
A secret society.
The others exchange looks.
TRUMAN
Let's take Agent Cooper for a
little ride.
Where to?

COOPER

TRUMAN
The Book House.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
A dusty parking lot surrounds the slightly seedy honky tonk.
Behind it, another, smaller structure. The Book House.
Sheriff Truman and the others arrive in a cruiser and a
patrol car, exit. Cooper takes a deep breath of cool night
air.
This way.

TRUMAN

Truman leads Cooper towards the Book House.



COOPER
How long have you been Sheriff,
Harry?
TRUMAN
Five years.
COOPER
How long have you been meeting
here?
TRUMAN
Longer than that.
(they, reach the door)
It's a funny thing. Seems like
every time you solve a mystery,
there's another one right behind
it.
Cooper smiles. He can appreciate that sort of thinking.
CUT TO:
INT. BOOK HOUSE NIGHT
They enter. It is a clubhouse of sorts, chairs and tables, a
comfortable atmosphere. And walls lined with bookshelves,
tomes on every imaginable topic. Cooper stops, reacts.
There's a burly hirsute MAN, wearing a gag, tied to a chair
at the center of the room. James Hurley and JOEY PAULSON
stand guard.
TRUMAN
You know James. Joey Paulson.
JAMES
Hello, Agent Cooper.
COOPER
Hello, James. Joey. Who's this?
TRUMAN
Bernard Renault. Jacques' brother.
Janitor had at the roadhouse.
Bernard had an ounce of cocaine in
his kit bag. Thought we'd ask him a
couple questions.
Cooper nods, getting into the spirit. Truman removes
Bernard's gag.



COOPER
(after a beat)
Did you ever sell drugs to Laura
Palmer?
BERNARD
(French-Canadian)
I don't sell drugs.
TRUMAN
How much does Jacques pay you to be
the mule?
BERNARD
Jacques don't pay me nothing, I'm
no mule.
TRUMAN
So that ounce we found, that was
for personal use?
BERNARD
That's right.
TRUMAN
Where's your brother been? Not at
work the last few days.
BERNARD
I don't know. He got business.
With who?

COOPER

BERNARD
I don't know.
TRUMAN
Who else does Jacques work with?
BERNARD
Why don't you ask him yourself? He
be back tonight. Any minute.
TRUMAN
He's coming to work?
BERNARD
(stating the obvious)
He the bartender, isn't he?
Bernard grins, triumphant. Cooper looks at Truman, steps
closer.



COOPER
Bernard, we have you tied up in a
chair. You're mixed up in a wide
variety of felonies with your
brother. What I want to know is,
why in the world would you tell us
when and where to find him?
That wipes the grin off his face. Bernard looks at his feet,
says nothing. Cooper doesn't mind. He already knows the
answer.
CUT TO:
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
JACQUES RENAULT walks down a country road, peers through the
dark at the Roadhouse in the distance. Jacques stops
suddenly, reacts.
JACQUES' POV - THE ROADHOUSE
There's a redlight on top of the honky-tonk, it shines and
blinks a warning. Jacques takes one look at it, knows what it
means. He turns and runs as fast as he can in the opposite
direction.
CUT TO:
INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Leo stands over the kitchen sink, carefully cleans and
polishes a pair of heavy boots. The phone rings. Leo sets the
boots on a towel, answers it.
Yeah?

LEO
INTERCUT:

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
Jacques is calling from a phone booth, breathless, sweating
from the run.
JACQUES
The bust light's on. Bernard's in
trouble.
You sure?

LEO



JACQUES
I saw it. You gotta get me out of
here, Leo. Border run.
LEO
Where are you?
JACQUES
Phone booth by the Cash and Carry.
I don't like waitin', man.
LEO
Shut up. I'm on my way.
Leo hangs up, grabs his jacket and a small bag. Shelly
enters, wonders.
SHELLY
Where you goin'?
LEO
You don't need to know.
He exits. Shelly grabs her purse, kneels down in the kitchen
near a cabinet. Without hesitation--she's done this before-Shelly carefully removes some of the cabinet's slats,
revealing a hiding place. She reaches into the hole, pulls
out Leo's bloody shirt. Satisfied, she returns it, then digs
into her purse, removes her brand new Colt .32, looks at it
for a beat. Then puts it with the shirt below and replaces
the slats.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Cooper, Truman, Ed, and Hawk exit, Truman heads for his
cruiser, gets on the radio.
TRUMAN
(to Cooper)
You and Hawk wait inside the
Roadhouse. Ed and I'll watch the
road, I'll call for some back-up.
COOPER
Jacques' half-way to the border by
now.
TRUMAN
We don't know that yet.



Cooper directs their attention to the blinking red light on
top of the Roadhouse.
COOPER
I don't remember seeing that
blinking red light before, do you?
The others look up. Truman realizes what's up. Hangs up his
radio.
TRUMAN
I'll take Bernard in and book him.
ED
I'll give you a hand, Harry.
TRUMAN
Hawk, why don't you run Agent
Cooper back to the Great Northern?
COOPER
(as they start off)
Buy you a drink, Hawk?
Hawk nods.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT
A short time later. A sad song plays on a jukebox. Couples
gather on the small dance floor, a few GUESTS mingle at the
bar. Cooper and Hawk sit at small table near the fireplace.
Their mood is quiet, contemplative. It's been a long day.
COOPER
(after a beat)
Did you know her, Hawk?
HAWK
Laura? Caught her speeding a couple
times. Let her talk me our of the
ticket. That wasn't hard.
COOPER
Laura Palmer didn't have to die.
It's wrong. It makes me mad.
HAWK
Everything dies.
A beat. Cooper takes a pull from a longneck beer. He quietly
wonders:



COOPER
Do you believe in the soul?
The question takes Hawk by surprise. He takes a closer look
at Cooper.
Several.

HAWK

COOPER
(curious)
More than one?
HAWK
Blackfeet legend. Waking souls that
give life to mind and body. A dream
soul that wanders.
COOPER
Where does it wander?
HAWK
Faraway places. The Land of the
Dead.
COOPER
Is that where Laura is?
HAWK
Laura's in the ground, Agent
Cooper. That's all I know for sure.
Cooper reacts, takes a closer look. Tommy 'The Hawk' Hill,
agnostic Blackfoot. There's more to him than meets the eye. A
beat. Cooper lifts his glass into the air, proposes a toast:
COOPER
To Laura. Godspeed.
They touch glasses, toast. That's when Cooper sees Leland
Palmer stepping between tables to the dance floor.
ON LELAND
Leland walks onto the dance floor, stands quite still. The
juke selects another title. Big band music pours into the
room. Leland listens intently. He looks up, his eyes bright
with tears. A beat. Leland Palmer begins to dance.
At first his actions go unnoticed. But gradually couples turn
to regard him, this sad man dancing across the floor. Some
giggle, others look with sympathy. Most begin to disperse.
But Leland keeps dancing, he pleads With those who remain:



LELAND
Dance with me. Please. Dance with
me.
As his pleadings grows more desperate, Cooper and Hawk step
quickly to the dance floor, mean to lead him away.
COOPER
Mr. Palmer. Leland?
HAWK
Mr. Palmer?
Gradually, Leland hears them, finally focusing on them.
COOPER
It's time to go home.
Pause. He nods weakly, Cooper and Hawk gently lead Leland
between them out of the room.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT.
Establish. A full moon sailing overhead.
CUT TO:
INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Lights are low, a small table has been set with silver,
candies, and white linen. A romantic supper for two. Josie
wears a silk robe, something sheer beneath it. Sheriff Truman
wears the ardent expression of a man in love.
Pete steps into view carrying dinner on a large platter.
PETE
Pan-fried Rainbow. Caught 'em this
morning.
Pete serves the trout to each.
JOSIE
Thank you, Pete.
PETE
It's nothing. Old family recipe.
Truman pours a little wine, offers:



TRUMAN
Pour you a glass, Pete?
PETE
No, no. You kids enjoy. Never mind
the dishes. We'll get 'em later.
He intends to leave them alone. Truman smiles appreciatively,
thanks Pete with a wink. He watches Pete step from the room.
A beat. Josie toys with her food, silent, preoccupied.
Something is troubling her. And Truman knows it.
TRUMAN
Heart a' gold, old Pete.
JOSIE
Yes, he is.
TRUMAN
Josie, what's wrong?
Nothing.
'Nothing.'

JOSIE
TRUMAN

Josie looks up from her dinner. Candlelight shimmers all
around her.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
God you're beautiful.
Josie tries to smile. But her eyes are full of fear. Truman
leans closer.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
Josie something's wrong, I want you
to tell me.
JOSIE
(after a beat)
They want to hurt me. I know they
do. Something horrible is going to
happen, Harry.
TRUMAN
Who? Who's going to hurt you?
JOSIE
Ben and Catherine.



CAMERA MOVES from the table, finally REVEALS an intercom
speaker on the wall, nearly out of sight, a silent ear
listening.
CUT TO:
INT. MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT
Catherine Martell sits at a small desk, car pressed close to
an intercom console/speaker. She manipulates the volume knob,
listening to every word they say.
JOSIE'S VOICE
Catherine keeps the mill account
books in her safe. Two books. Two
accounts.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
(alert)
Two? Can you show me?
CUT TO:
INT. BLUE PINE LODGE OFFICE - NIGHT
Josie leads Truman into the office, trips the hidden catch,
releases the false bookshelf, and reveals the wall safe. She
inserts the key, tugs at the handle.
JOSIE
Why would she keep two sets of
books?
TRUMAN
The usual reasons would have
something to do with stealing.
Maybe more.
Josie opens the safe, both look inside, react. There is only
one ledger inside.
JOSIE
But there were two.
Truman removes the ledger, thumbs through it.
TRUMAN
Nothing unusual here.



JOSIE
(whispered, trembling)
There were two.
CUT TO:
INT. MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT
Catherine smiles. She's holding the other ledger in her hand.
Just then: footsteps, Pete enters. She slips the ledger in a
drawer and turns down the intercom. Pete catches this last
action.
PETE
(all innocence)
Have you seen my tackle box?
CATHERINE
The next time you and the merry
widow want a peek in my safe, don't
go to so much trouble. Be a man
about it, Pete. Ask me to my face.
Pete stares at her for a beat. He'll fight another day.
PETE
Maybe I'll check the truck.
Pete exits. Catherine gloats.
CUT TO:
INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Truman and Josie sit before the wood-burning stove. Josie
burrows into Truman's arms, shivers, speaks just above a
whisper, revealing her deepest fears:
JOSIE
When Andrew died I was so alone. I
couldn't think, I didn't know what
to do. Catherine said she would
help me. And Ben would help me too.
TRUMAN
(figuring)
Ben and Catherine...
JOSIE
They lied to me. They didn't care
about Andrew. They didn't care
about me. All they want is to take
the mill away from me.
(MORE)


JOSIE (CONT'D)

(beat)
I have never said this before to
anyone. Harry, I believe Andrew's
death was not an accident. And I
believe they will try to kill me
too.
A tear runs from her eye. Truman pulls her closer, trying to
make some sense of this.
TRUMAN
Josie, Josie. Nothing's going to
happen to you. Not now, not ever.
I'll make damn sure of that.
Oh, Harry.

JOSIE

Truman kisses her gently. Josie sighs, returns his kiss with
greater fervor. They settle into a long embrace, whisper
between kisses.
TRUMAN
You don't have to be afraid.
Josie places her head against his chest, holds on tight.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
(softly continues)
Days like today, death feels like
the biggest thing in the world. But
it's not, Josie. Nor for us.
JOSIE
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid
of losing you.
A beat. Josie begins to recite while trembling in his arms:
JOSIE (CONT'D)
All things howsoever they flourish
Return to the root from which they
grew. This return to the root is
called Quietness; Quietness is
called submission to Fate; What has
submitted to Fate has become part
of the always- so. To know the
always-so is to be Illumined; Not
to know it, means to go blindly to
disaster.
(beat)
He who knows the always-so has room
in him for everything;
(MORE)


JOSIE (CONT'D)
He who has room in him for
everything is without prejudice. To
be without prejudice is to be
kingly; To be kingly is to be of
heaven; To be of heaven is to be in
Tao. Tao is forever and he that
posssess it, Though his body
ceases, is not destroyed.

HOLD ON Josie for a beat. Safe in Truman's arms.
CUT TO:
EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT
Cooper stands watch at the cemetery, a night wind howling
about him. He peers into the dark, Laura's grave in the
distance. The Land of the Dead. A beat, then:
CARETAKER'S VOICE
Can you hear 'em?
Cooper turns to find an old CARETAKER at his side, gazing out
into the night.
CARETAKER
It's the metal and the wood, I
guess. Some caskets, you stick 'em
in the ground, and the wood starts
to expand, starts to rub against
that metal. And if it rubs just so,
you get a strange sort of sound. If
the night's just right, and the
wood--teak and brass are the best-well, it's like music. You can
almost hear the caskets singin'.
Needless to say, it's a notion Cooper finds fascinating.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT
Minutes later. CAMERA STARTS AT GROUND LEVEL, green grass,
dark graves. Suddenly Cooper LOWERS INTO FRAME, presses his
ear to the ground. As if to listen for the casket's singing.
That's when he hears another sound. Footsteps, someone
walking toward Laura Palmer's grave.
Cooper slips into the shadows. He watches a lone figure step
to Laura's grave. But he can't make out the face. At least
until the mystery man lights a cigarette.



COOPER'S POV
It is Dr. Lawrence Jacoby. He inhales deeply, stares down at
Laura's grave. He holds a bouquet of flowers in his free
hand.
CUT TO:
EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT
Jacoby sets the flowers by the headstone. Cooper steps into
view, speaks gently.
COOPER
Dr. Jacoby?
(silence)
I didn't see you at the funeral.
A long beat. Jacoby finally turns to Cooper, seems to notice
him for the first time. Then, eyes bright with tears, he
whispers:
JACOBY
I'm a terrible person, Agent
Cooper. I pretend that I'm not. But
I am.
Cooper says nothing. He'll let the man talk.
JACOBY (CONT'D)
I listen to their problems all day.
I give them advice, solutions that
are supposed to "improve" their
lives. These people think of me as
a friend.
(beat)
But the truth is, I... I don't
really care. When I'm not working I
wear ear plugs so I don't have to
hear them talk. Nothing... ever...
touches me.
(beat)
Except for Laura.
(beat)
I couldn't come today. I just
couldn't.
(a whisper)
I hope she'll understand...
HOLD ON them for a beat. Jacoby's sad tears in the dark.
FADE OUT:


THE END



ACT ONE
FADE IN:
EXT. THE PALMER HOUSE MORNING
Establish.
CUT TO:
INT. PALMER'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
The homecoming photograph of Laura Palmer sits on a table
next to the sofa.
We see a SKETCH PAD, a portrait of a frightening man, with
long, filthy hair. Deputy ANDY BRENNAN sits on the sofa
making the sketch. SARAH PALMER sits next to him, describing
the man in her vision in a tense whisper. Next to Sarah and
holding her hand is DONNA HAYWARD. Behind them stands SHERIFF
TRUMAN, studying Andy's work. On a chair beside the couch DOC
HAYWARD sits with medication at the ready.
SARAH
His hair was long. Filthy grey on
grey, long hair.
MADELEINE FERGUSON appears quietly behind Truman with a tray
of coffee cups. She hands one to Truman and another cup to
Doc Hayward. She starts to place a cup in front of Sarah, but
with a gentle hand the doctor discourages this.
SARAH (CONT'D)
(struggling)
I saw him, by the foot of Laura's
bed. He was like an animal.
The scene is interrupted by a thump at the doorway. LELAND
PALMER totters in, unshaven.
TRUMAN
Had you ever seen this man before?
SARAH
No... never.
Andy looks at Truman, who nods; Andy shows the sketch to
Sarah.
SARAH (CONT'D)
His face... oh, God, his face
Sarah's head rocks back on to the top of the sofa. She's
starting to lose it.


LELAND
Sarah? Have you told them about the
necklace? They'll love that one.
TRUMAN
Necklace?
LELAND
She had two visions.
(winks at them)
TRUMAN
Go ahead, Sarah.
Leland rises and heads unsteadily out of the room.
SARAH
It's night. A flashlight beam moves
across the ground then a hand... a
gloved hand... lifts a rock and
takes out a necklace. Broken in
half... it was Laura's...
CAMERA MOVES IN on a frightened Donna.
CUT TO:
A TELEVISION
Opening credits of Invitation to Love." Scarlet red flowing
script writes out the title.
ANNOUNCER
...INVITATION TO LOVE...
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Lucy sits at her desk glued to a small portable televison
set.
CUT TO:
"INVITATION TO LOVE"
EMERALD, poured into a dress with a plunging neckline, slinks
toward CHET.
EMERALD
Don't fight it, Chet.


CHET
I'm still married to Jade. It's
wrong.
(he turns away, struggling
to control himself)
God... you're evil...
EMERALD
For once in your life, Chet, you're
exactly right.
(she takes Chet into a
passionate kiss)
I want to see my father's will,
Chet.
(another kiss. Chet melts)
Get it for me.
CUT TO:
LUCY
Entering the station, Andy and Truman cruise up to her
window.
TRUMAN
'Morning, Lucy, what's going on?
LUCY
Thanks to Jade, Jared decided not
to kill himself and he's changed
his will leaving the Towers to Jade
instead of Emerald, but Emerald
found out about it and now she's
trying to seduce Chet to give her
the new will so she can destroy it
and Montana's planning to kill
Jared at midnight so the Towers
will belong to Emerald and Montana,
but I think Emerald's going to
doublecross him and he doesn't know
it yet. Poor Chet.
TRUMAN
What's going on... here.
LUCY
Agent Cooper is in the conference
room with Dr. Jacoby.
Truman starts for the conference room. Andy hangs back to
talk to Lucy.


ANDY
So I guess Chet's really got his
hands full, huh?... Lucy, why
couldn't I spend the night last
night?
LUCY
And will you be having coffee as
well, Deputy Brennan?
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY
DR. JACOBY and AGENT DALE COOPER sit across the table from
each other. Jacoby plays idly with a golf ball, practicing
sleight-of-hand.
COOPER
Was Laura Palmer seeing you because
she was addicted to cocaine?
JACOBY
I'd like to help you, Agent Cooper.
Maybe there is some sort of hula we
can do around my doctor-patient
confidentiality.
The blackboard from Episode Two stands behind Cooper. The map
of Tibet looks over Cooper's shoulder. Jacoby rises and
circles towards it. Truman enters. Cooper nods to him.
COOPER
It is safe to say Laura came to see
you because she had problems.
JACOBY
Oh my yes.
COOPER
Were her problems of a sexual
nature?
JACOBY
Agent Cooper, the problems of our
entire society are of a sexual
nature.
(studies the map)
Tibet. My abiding interests lie to
the east as well, though only as
far as Hawaii. Five years postgraduate work.
(MORE)


JACOBY (CONT'D)
There are sound solutions to our
diseased family structures in
native Hawaiian culture.
COOPER
So there were problems at home.
JACOBY
The ancient Hawaiians often turned
to the soothing rhizome of the
ginger plant to case the pain of
profound confusion which, more
often than not, was sexual.
COOPER
Ginger is not addictive. Cocaine
is.
JACOBY
The fact that Laura Palmer sought
medication, no matter how dubious,
was actually a positive sign.
COOPER
(frustrated)
Dr. Jacoby, I know that you cared
deeply for Laura. Why won't you
help us?
JACOBY
I would like to. My own personal
investigation, I suspect, will be
ongoing for the rest of my life.
(not unaffected)
Laura had secrets. And around those
secrets she built a fortress that
in my six months with her I could
not penetrate. For which I consider
myself an abject failure.
TRUMAN
Did she discuss Bobby Briggs and
James Hurley?
JACOBY
They were boys. Laura was a woman.
COOPER
She had sex with three men the
night she died. Were you one of
them?


JACOBY
No.
COOPER
(bottom line)
Who killed her, Dr. Jacoby?
JACOBY
(walking a fine line)
The night after Laura died I
followed a man Laura had spoken to
me about. He was driving a red
corvette. I lost him near the Old
Sawmill Road. That, gentlemen, is
all I can tell you.
Lucy interrupts on the intercom.
LUCY'S VOICE
Agent Cooper, there is a Gordon
Cole on the phone. He says you're
expecting his call and that I
should put him through to you,
should I?
COOPER
Put him through.
(to Jacoby)
That will be all.
TRUMAN
You'll be in town, Doctor?
JACOBY
I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble
Beach, but that's not 'til the end
of the month.
(wiggles his thumb and
little finger)
Hang loose, Houlies.
He's gone. Cooper sets up the speaker phone on the table in
front of a chair.
COOPER
Does Leo Johnson drive a red
corvette?
TRUMAN
Yes.
COOPER
Anything more on Jacques Renault?


TRUMAN
There's an APB on him. His brother
Bernie made bail this morning. I've
put a tail on him.
COOPER
This is my supervisor calling.
(punches in the call on
the speaker)
Good morning, Gordon, how are we
doing?
COLE'S VOICE
(all business)
Coop. Where do you want to start?
The Palmer girl or Albert's new
best friend, Harry Truman.
COOPER
(with a look to Truman)
Laura Palmer.
COLE'S VOICE
Albert has been very busy despite
the handsome shiner. The twine he
found on her upper arms is a common
household variety: Finley's Fine
Twine.
COOPER
And the twine on her wrists?
COLE'S VOICE
Definitely not a match. No ID yet.
And those marks on her shoulders?
Bird bites. Albert thinks he'll
have specifics this afternoon visa-vis genus and species.
TRUMAN
(over)
Bird bites?
COLE'S VOICE
He'll also be faxing a
reconstruction of the plastic
fragment from her stomach.
COOPER
Tell Albert we're anxiously
awaiting his results.


COLE'S VOICE
Now for the bad news. Coop, I've
got an O.O.J. and an A.F.O. here
from Albert concerning his mano y
mano with the local Sheriff Truman.
Truman makes a gesture offering to leave. Cooper motions him
to stay.
COLE
Albert wants this guy's badge.
We can almost hear Harry's expletive as he goes to the
window.
COOPER
Gordon, here's how it is: you know
Albert. In my opinion, Sheriff
Truman displayed the patience of a
saint in not clocking him a day
earlier than he did-COLE'S VOICE
He wants it filed with the U.S.
Attorney-COOPER
File it under "f" for "forget it"-COLE'S VOICE
Coop-COOPER
And you tell Albert, if he wants to
pursue this I'll fight him all the
way up the chain to Washington.
I'll talk to you later, Gordon.
Cooper hangs up as Andy enters with his sketch.
TRUMAN
I thanks, I didn't sleep too well
last night.
COOPER
Harry, the last thing you're gonna
worry about while I'm here is some
city slicker I brought into your
town relieving himself upstream.
(takes the sketch from
Andy)
This is the man I saw in my dream.


TRUMAN
You saw this man?
COOPER
I had an intuition that my dream
and Sarah Palmer's vision were
connected. I didn't go with you
this morning so I wouldn't
influence her. I'm a strong sender.
(he hands the sketch back
to Andy)
The eyes were a bit closer
together.
The intercom buzzes.
LUCY'S VOICE
Deputy Hawk calling in for Agent
Cooper?
COOPER
(picks up the phone)
Hawk?... Right... stay there.
Follow him if he moves.
(hangs up)
Traveling east on Highway 12, how
long will it take us to get to the
Pine View Motel?
ANDY
Half an hour-TRUMAN
Ten minutes.
ANDY
Depends which way you go.
COOPER
Hawk's found our one-armed Man.

HURLEY'S HOUSE - DAY


ED and his assistant, SPARKY, a wizened eager beaver, enter
and tiptoe into the living room to examine Nadine's rowing
machine. The oars are bent like a "z."
ED
Watch you don't track any grease,
Sparky.
(they kneel down and look
at the machine)
How the heck could Nadine bend the
thing like that?
SPARKY
That's tempered steel, Edsker.
Ed glances at the window, picks up the phone.
ED
Nadine's still rummaging around out
in the garage. Catch an eye, will
ya, Sparky.
SPARKY
Safe as houses, Edsker.
Ed dials. After a couple of rings his call is answered.
ED
Shelly... hi, it's Ed Hurley. I

important.

Chet searches through a pile of legal briefs beside a bed
where JARED sleeps soundly.
SHELLY
You just missed her, Ed. She's left
for Hank's parole hearing.
ED
Shoot. Shelly, when she gets back
could you tell her...


Sparky sees Nadine approaching. He gives Ed the high sign,
takes out a wrench and moves back to the rowing machine.
NADINE HURLEY enters carrying a breakfast tray.
ED (CONT'D)
...you tell Mrs. Milford not to
drive anywhere without an extra set
of lug nuts.
He hangs up the phone and turns to Nadine. She displays the
tray, loaded with food, a newspaper, a pot of coffee and a
grease gun. Nadine smiles seductively at Ed.
NADINE
Eggs and bacon and sausage and ham
and and whole wheat toast and juice
and coffee. And the sports section,
and a grease gun for working on my
rower.
ED
(confused)
What's the occasion, Nadine?
NADINE
(whispers seductively in
his ear)
I'm gonna get a good lawyer, Ed.
She kisses him. He's alarmed. She whispers.
NADINE (CONT'D)
There's a damn good patent lawyer

NORMA JENNINGS sits pensively on a bench outside the door.
WILSON MOONEY, the parole officer, emerges from another door
to the cell block.


MOONEY
I've arranged for you to have a
little chat with Hank before the
hearing. He's glad you're here.
(a tad nervous)
Hope I didn't come on too strong
yesterday-NORMA
I'll be sure to tell him how
helpful you've been, Mr. Mooney.
Mooney moves off. The door to the cell block opens and HANK
JENNINGS is led out by a GUARD. Hank is forty, good looking
in a rough way. Alarmingly charming. He brightens as the
Guard leads him towards Norma who slowly stands as Hank
reaches her.
HANK
Haven't seen you for awhile, Norma.
NORMA
Been kind'a busy.
HANK
So... business is good.
NORMA
Yeah.
Pause. Hank seems suddenly, terribly vulnerable.
HANK
Back me up in there, Norma, please.
I gotta get out. It's starting to
put the zap on me, big time.
NORMA
(pause, a whisper)
You think it's that easy?
HANK
I know I've got no right to ask and
you've got no reason to believe me,
but... I'll change. I swear on my
life. I have changed. Give me a
chance to prove it to you.
The Guard steps back in and moves him away. A hint of
weakness in Norma's eyes.
CUT TO:


INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - DAY
Hank sits at a long table with Mooney, across from two BOARD
MEMBERS, a middle-aged neatnik and a younger woman with a
granite bouffant hairdo. Three other BOARD MEMBERS are spread
around the table. Norma sits to one side and watches Hank.
HANK
I've replayed it my mind a million
times. I just don't have any
answers. A car in perfect condition
goes out of control. A vagrant
nobody knows is killed sleeping on
the roadside. Why? Why did fate
deal me this hand?
MALE BOARD MEMBER
You were not incarcerated for an
act of fate, Mr. Jennings.
HANK
I accept that. But it was fate,
maybe in an odd way, even luck that
sent me to prison. Just as much as
that accident.
WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
What is your point?
HANK
That my time here has been good for
me. You don't spend eighteen months
in a nine-by-five box without
facing your life. Without figuring
what went wrong with your life
before. Without planning to make it
better. Without learning to get
down on your hands and knees and
pray for a second chance.
(pause)
I know I've got a lot to make up
for. The life I destroyed... and
another life I very nearly
destroyed.
Hank takes a long loving look at Norma. Board members study
her.
WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
Mrs. Jennings, your husband would
be facing a difficult re-entry. How
would you help him?


NORMA
I own the Double R Diner in Twin
Peaks. I can give him a job. The
boss is tough, but fair.
This gets a slight chuckle from the board.
WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
And you would live together as man
and wife?
Pause. Hank edges his seat forward, it makes a loud scraping
noise. Norma looks at Hank.
NORMA
He's my husband, isn't he?
Pause. Hank mouths a silent, "thank you."
MALE BOARD MEMBER
We've got what we need here. We'll
decide what recommendation to make
without the inmate present.
WOMAN BOARD MEMBER TWO
We'll let you know by five o'clock
today.
Hank idly rubs a key chain. Its handle is a WHITE DOMINO with
SIX BLACK DOTS.

immediately lights a cigarette.
AUDREY
I've been doing some research. In
real life there is no algebra.
DONNA
Maybe you should run away and join
the circus.
AUDREY
Escape! I've got a better idea. A
tall, dark and handsome stranger
falls madly in love with me and
takes me away to a life of mystery
and international intrigue.
DONNA
You mean that FBI Agent? Dream on.
AUDREY
Maybe. Or maybe he'll realize I'm
the woman of his dreams because I'm
going to help him figure out who
killed Laura.
DONNA
Is that so?
AUDREY
Yes. And you're going to help me.
Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley
behind Bobby's back.
DONNA
(defensive)
What if she was?
AUDREY
(off her reaction)
So it is true. Fact: Laura had a
sweet tooth for nose candy.
DONNA
I guess that's not such a big
secret.


AUDREY
Please. I didn't know Laura half as
well as you and I knew the score;
Laura was wild. Will you help me?
DONNA
(getting into it)
What else have you figured out,
Sherlock?
AUDREY
The morning of the funeral, Dr.
Jacoby's talking to my, brother
Johnny, trying to get him to go to
the funeral...
(offers a cigarette to
Donna who declines)
So he tells Johnny that Laura was
in a better place now, blah, blah,
blah and he knows that...
because... Laura was his patient.
DONNA
(new information)
Laura was seeing Jacoby?
AUDREY
Mucho de-weirdo, huh? It gets
better. Ever heard of "One-Eyed
Jacks?"
DONNA
Isn't that a Western with Marlon
Brando?
AUDREY
No. It's a place up north across
the border. They have "girls"
working there.
Audrey takes a long drag on her cigarette for effect. Donna's
intrigued
DONNA
Are you saying you think Laura was
one of them?
AUDREY
I don't know. But if it's true,
wouldn't you want to know about it?
DONNA
It sure would explain a few things.


AUDREY
You know, I think about it, I think
about Laura being in a place like
that and I get all shivery, but
it's like a hot cold, like when you
hold an ice cube on your bare skin
for a long time.
DONNA
Audrey, I'll help you but whatever
we find out, we have to promise to
keep this between ourselves. Our
secret.
AUDREY
It's a deal. And I know exactly
where to start, did you know
Ronette and Laura worked at the
same place.
Donna didn't. The school bell rings for class. Audrey douses

My desk, upstairs. A drop panel in

Catherine takes a sip of wine, turns off the TV set with a

I'd prefer that we get on with
setting the torch to that damn
mill. Because I want... fill in the

BEN

Darling, one crosses the border
into arson cautiously or not at
all. When the mill goes up in
smoke, the headline we're after is
"Josie Packard torches bankrupt
mill in insurance fraud" not "giant
wienie roast in the woods."
CATHERINE
That's fine and dandy. Just bear in
mind, "darling," that if this
opportunity is wasted, or you in

INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ben Home is on the telephone, looking at a globe.


BEN
--Jerry, Jer, slow down, I know
you're in Iceland but where are you
in Iceland?... how do you spell
that? Two 'k's', one 'f', one
'v'...
(locates it on the globe)
Yeah, I see it, Jerry, are you
drunk?... what's all that noise?...
you're in the sauna now or... I
see... no, I don't need to talk to
anyone else...
(Jerry has handed the
phone to an Icelander)
Hello, yes, "qvath sejir" to you
too, sir... okay, put my brother
back on would you?... a joke? sure,
go ahead...
(the Icelander tells Ben a
joke)
"...og die panne flak der Mann?"...
(he laughs along with the
Icelander on other end)
That's hilarious... put Jerry back
on now, please...
(Jerry is back on)
Bottom line, Jer: Ghostwood
Estates, are these tundra tycoons
in or out?... very encouraging,
that and a quarter'll buy me a
piece of ice on a stick... you're
flying in when? Tonight? That's
outstanding... how many? Fifteen?
Do they all need separate rooms?...
The intercom buzzes and we hear a SECRETARY'S VOICE.
SECRETARY'S VOICE
Mr. Horne, we've got a situation in
the dining room.
Ben can hear distant strains of "In the Mood" from another
part of the hotel. Ben's alarmed.
BEN
Jerry? Jerry, I've got to go, get
those high-rolling snowballs on the
plane, I'll see you here in the
morning.
He hangs up and heads directly for the door.
CUT TO:


INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
In the bar area, Leland Palmer is dancing what looks to be a
cross between the Lindy and the Tennessee Waltz with his
SECRETARY, a middle-aged gal in a suit. The Secretary looks
to Ben, hoping for something just short of gunplay to rescue
her. On the other hand, she's a hell of a dancer. Overall,
they look good.
LELAND
Dance with me! Dance with me!
BEN
Leland. Leland.
Leland goes into a dance solo towards Ben. Hands him a framed
picture. Ben looks at it: a snapshot photo of Laura and
Audrey.
LELAND
This was on your desk! Our
daughters, together!
Ben pushes his way in between Leland and the secretary.
BEN
Mind if I cut in?
Once in, Ben moves the Secretary away from Leland. Ben lets
her out of the room, goes back to Leland and grabs him firmly
by the shoulders.
BEN (CONT'D)
Leland. Leland. You gave me that
picture, remember?
(Leland comes to a stop)
Calm down. Stop it.
LELAND
She loved dancing. She loved to
dance... she'd stand on my shoes...
I taught her... come and dance with
me... she was a good little
dancer...
He cries. Ben takes him into an embrace. Pats him on the
back.
CUT TO:


INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Cooper, Truman, Andy and Hawk enter carrying files from the
veterinarian's, past Lucy at reception. Truman rests his for
a moment on Lucy's counter.
TRUMAN
Fellas, take 'em right into the
conference room. Lucy, I need you
to go through these files and pull
out all the people who own birds.
LUCY
How will I know they own birds?
TRUMAN
It will say so on the cards.
LUCY
Okay, I'll start going through the
files, then.
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION A - DAY
Hawk sets his box down and exits. Cooper is about to exit
when Andy takes him aside.
ANDY
Agent Cooper? I'm so sorry, I don't
know what happened, the gun just
slipped out of my hand.
COOPER
Have you ever used your weapon in
the line of duty?
ANDY
No, sir, I haven't. I can't explain
what happened, I've been feeling a
little high-strung-COOPER
It was a lack of preparation. We'll
take care of that.
TRUMAN ENTERS TO SAY:
TRUMAN
Andy, get some ammunition from the
lockbox and meet us downstairs at
the pistol range.


Cooper and Truman exit.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Andy goes into Lucy's office to retrieve a key. Lucy won't
look at him, slides her chair out of the way, lets him take
the key. Andy's aching.
ANDY
Lucy, did you hear what happened? I
feel so dumb. I dropped my gun and
it went off.
LUCY
(a hint of concern)
Are you okay?
ANDY
Oh, yeah, I guess so, but I...
LUCY
(remembering the war of
the sexes)
I would like to chat, but I am now
under orders to examine these
files, so if you'll excuse me
please?
She exits. Andy's completely perplexed.
CUT TO:
INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk set up at the basement shooting
range. There are two targets at the end of corridors for them
to shoot at.
COOPER
Laura Palmer's murder was vicious
and calculated. There's no telling
what we'll encounter bringing a
suspect to ground. After Andy's
accident at the motel I want to be
absolutely certain we're all
comfortable and confident with our
firearms.
Cooper takes out his gun. The other two admire it.
HAWK
Nice piece.


COOPER
Actually it's regular issue, but
I've made some modifications.
(to Truman)
How long has Lucy been upset with
Andy?
TRUMAN
(thinks he knows how)
Body language?
COOPER
In this case, it was yelling
through a megaphone.
Before Truman can talk about him, Andy arrives with the ammo.
TRUMAN
Six rounds apiece to start with,
Andy.
ANDY
(still with and on Lucy)
Okay.
Andy glumly distributes bullets to the others, who load up.
Cooper slickly arms his own gun with a clip from his pocket.
COOPER
Care to tell us about you and Lucy,
Andy?
ANDY
Geez, you can tell?
TRUMAN
Not too many secrets left around
here.
ANDY
She won't speak to me and I don't
know what I did and I don't know
why she's doing what she's doing.
COOPER
(chairing the discussion)
Andy, there are a number of old
saying which might pertain to this
discussion. Suffice it to say
you're up against the oldest
unsolvable mystery known to man.


ANDY
And I feel like I don't know one
doggone thing.
TRUMAN
It's weird. The mystery's what I
like the most... and the less I
know the more interested I get.
A look between Cooper and Truman. Josie.
ANDY
But I just can't figure her out.
COOPER
There's no logic at work here,
Andy. Let that one go. In the grand
design, women were drawn from a
different set of blueprints.
HAWK
Amen to that.
TRUMAN
Hawk, Andy.
COOPER
Rapid fire.
All four men put on headphone ear protectors. Hawk and Andy
fire six rapid shots down their separate corridors. Truman
hits a button, the targets to return. They take off their
protectors.
TRUMAN
(to Cooper, back to women)
So where do you stand on the
mystery of it all?
Cooper inspects Hawk and Andy's targets.
COOPER
Harry, the way I look at it a
mystery's just a solution waiting
for the right set of facts. Here,
we're dealing with an area that's
closer to a paradox or an enigma...
(examining the targets)
Hawk, six of six, two kills, high
marks... Andy...
(being delicate)
What you need is practice and
plenty of it.
(MORE)


COOPER (CONT'D)
One hour, three times a week.
Harry, you'll supply the ordinance?
TRUMAN
Whatever it takes.
COOPER
Chin up, Andy.
TRUMAN
(as he and Cooper prepare
to shoot)
Ever been married, Cooper?
COOPER
No. I knew someone once who helped
me understand commitment, it's
responsibilities and it's risks
The four put their ear protectors back on.
COOPER (CONT'D)
(alone)
...who taught me about the pain of
a broken heart.
Cooper and Truman fire six shots. Truman hits the button to
return the targets.
HAWK
One woman can make you fly like the
eagle, another can give you the
strength of a lion. But only one in
the cycle of life will fill your
heart with wonder and the wisdom
that you have known a singular joy.
This stops the group.
HAWK (CONT'D)
I wrote that about my girlfriend.
COOPER
Local gal?
HAWK
Darlene Shapiro, PHD Brandeis.
Legal counsel for the Bureau of
Indian Affairs.
Cooper whistles in appreciation, then looks at Truman's
target, as Cooper looks at his.


COOPER
Harry, one miss, five hits, three
kills. Excellent.
Truman holds Cooper's. Disappointed.
TRUMAN
I don't see a hit here.
COOPER
I put four shots through the eyes
and one through each nostril.
Hawk takes the target out of Truman's hands. Holds it up to
the light. Cooper has used his six shots to pierce the
nostrils and the eyes. Light comes through from behind. The
threesome stares in awe. We hear a beep, then Lucy's voice on
the intercom.
LUCY'S VOICE
Agent Cooper, I am looking at the
files from Dr. Lydecker's? And for
instance I have here in the "A's"
an Arky, who's a part poodle-part
rotweiler, who lives on Maple and
belongs to Mr. Rumple, then for
example I have an Annette, who is a
otter who lives with a family near
Elk River
COOPER
We wanted the names of birds
LUCY
I know, but the files are all
organized alphabetically
TRUMAN
So go through the bird section-LUCY
No, no, you don't understand;
they're organized alphabetically in
the name of the pet.
Cooper and Truman look at each other.
COOPER
We're gonna need some more coffee.
CUT TO:


EXT. JAMES HURLEY'S HOME - DAY
A housetrailer in the middle of a lonely lot with a couple of
aluminum lean-to's off the house. The shades on the windows
are drawn. James is working on his Harley under a lean-to.
James looks up as a car drives down the driveway to the
house. COLLEEN HURLEY exits the car, laughing, carrying a
small suitcase. She's forty, gave James his good looks. Her's
are on the way out. She waves goodbye to the unidentified
MIDDLE-AGED GENT behind the wheel and the car drives off.
Colleen sees James, waves, moves towards him.
COLLEEN
There he is, the fair-haired boy,
where have you been, my fair-haired
boy?
JAMES
I was at school. It's a school day.
COLLEEN
(takes out a flask)
God bless the public indoctrination
system. Keeps the kids off the
streets... streets are for streetcars and street-sweepers...
(takes a drink)
JAMES
Where'd you go this time?
COLLEEN
Taught a kid in prison once, this
was Ohio, all he wanted out of life
was a job as a San Francisco street
sweeper
JAMES
Ma, you been gone four days.
COLLEEN
Kiddo, here's how it is; when the
muse cries out, we're helpless to
resist. A poem, she said, four days
worth. Yes, I replied.
JAMES
(trying to hide his
feelings)
Are you okay?


COLLEEN
Myself, I've been better. The
poem's pretty good.
Takes out a legal pad from the messy suitcase.
COLLEEN (CONT'D)
I learned early on, write it down,
escape the humdrum hand that life
has dealt you. Play with marked
cards.
(puts on glasses, reads)
"Poet lariat/Rope, Rope/Bulldogged
down, Rodeo Town/The last of the
Sabine Women--"
JAMES
I don't want to hear this right
now-COLLEEN
"--Sun goes down, rodeo town/Lariat
ropes a--"
JAMES
Stop!
She takes off her glasses, looks at him.
COLLEEN
Jimmy, are we being rude?
James picks up the flask, pours the remainder in the dirt.
COLLEEN (CONT'D)
Okay, sonny boy, if it makes you
feel better -JAMES
(turns on her)
You don't know... anything!
COLLEEN
I know girl trouble when I see it.
Some little logtown siren's cut you
up. I recognize the wound patterns.
JAMES
(almost laughs)
Yeah, you sure can spot it, Ma.
COLLEEN
Am I right?


An awful, bitter pause.
JAMES
Her name was Laura.
COLLEEN
Lash yourself to the mast,
Odysseus.
(lifts her drink)
Eat the lotus. Forget her. Sail on.
(she strokes his face,
compassionate)
The danger for you, my darling boy,
is you'll never know whether she's
an angel or a harpie sent from hell
to rend your heart, because believe
me, she'll be one or the other.
James is close to tears. He can't combat this.
JAMES
She was both.
COLLEEN
Ah, but that's the secret, Jimmy
boy. They all are.
James is sickened. He lurches out the door.

the counter after a customer, a YOUNG TRUCKER who is just
leaving. Norma looks at his tip.
NORMA
Thanks, Toad, I'll get this into my
retirement fund A.S.A.P.
Shelly hurries in. She storms by Norma, grabs her apron and
heads to the kitchen. Norma follows her, catching up with her
at the coffee maker. Good-naturedly.
NORMA (CONT'D)
Shelly, you're gonna scare the
customers.


SHELLY
I've got one man too many in my
life. And I'm married to him. Sound
familiar?
NORMA
You think it's time you and Leo
have a talk?
SHELLY
Leo doesn't talk. He hits. He was
so great at first, you know? This
flashy guy in his hot car; sure
beat sitting in some stupid
classroom... we get married and I
find out what he's lookin' for is a
maid he doesn't have to pay... I
feel so stupid.
Norma gives her a hug.
NORMA
Look at us. Two men apiece and we
don't know what to do with any of
the four of 'em.
SHELLY
(feeling comforted)
How did Hank's hearing go?
NORMA
They said they'd decide this
afternoon.
SHELLY
Have you told him you're going to
divorce him for Ed?
NORMA
When I saw him I... anyway, he
might not get out this time around.
Guess my plans are a little... up
in the air.
SHELLY
(cryptically)
Yeah, well, I definitely got plans
for Leo.
Norma tries to penetrate her look. James enters the diner and
goes right to the pay phones.


NORMA
Shelly, you know what we're going
to do tomorrow? You and I are going
to have a Day of Beauty. Manicure,
haircut, facial, the works. We are
going to be the knockouts of the

recipe, wearing an apron that reads, "Genius at Work." Donna
laughs when she sees him...
HAYWARD
Donna, who the heck ever heard of
diet lasagne?
DONNA
Just a sec--Daddy, please, I'll be
right in, it's James--we're having
the church pot luck dinner here
tonight.
HAYWARD
Tell him to get over here, I need
help. SOS, Mayday, Mayday.
He goes back in the kitchen. She speaks more confidentially.
DONNA
Would you like to come?


JAMES
I don't think I'd be very good
company.
DONNA
James, we need to talk. I've found
some stuff out; Audrey told me some
stuff and Mrs. Palmer saw
something-JAMES
What?
James sees Madeleine Ferguson waiting at the counter talking
to Norma.
DONNA
Come over later so I can tell you.
Will you come?
JAMES
Okay. I'm gonna get something to
eat then I'll be over.
STAY WITH James. He hangs up. He looks up and sees...
INTERCUT:
JAMES POV - NORMA AND MADELEINE
NORMA
I think it's ready, let me go
check.
MADELEINE
Thanks a lot.
Practically trembling, James goes up to her. Madeleine looks
up, gives him a friendly smile.
MADELEINE (CONT'D)
Hi.
JAMES
Who are you?
MADELEINE
I saw you yesterday at the funeral.
My name's Madeleine Ferguson. Laura
was my cousin.


JAMES
(still not really with
her)
James Hurley.
MADELEINE
Laura was a month older than me.
Hadn't seen each other much
recently. I live in Missoula. I'm a
receptionist at a insurance
company?
(instinctively trying to
cheer him up)
Ever been to Missoula?
JAMES
I heard it was nice.
MADELEINE
From who?
(James smiles)
So you can smile. Missoula's not so
bad actually.
(tries another subject)
Did you know Laura well?
JAMES
I thought I did.
Shelly sets Madeleine's order on the counter.
MADELEINE
Thanks a lot.
(to James)
I'm picking up food for my aunt and
uncle. Aunt Sarah can't cook right
now and Uncle Leland's up half the
night listening to old music and
crying and stuff. But if I was
cooking for them they'd be doing
even worse. You think I look like
Laura?
JAMES
Yes.
MADELEINE
We used to come visit Twin Peaks
when I was a kid. It was great.
We'd pretend we were sisters. I
wished I'd known her better. It's
so sad.
James stares at Madeline. She smiles back, uncomplicated.


MADELEINE (CONT'D)
Well it was nice to meet you, James
Hurley.
James involuntarily begins to reach across death's void for
Laura. Then catches himself.
JAMES
Nice to meet you too.

That's very good could you put

Ben hangs up, spins the globe around. He looks up to discover
Audrey standing in his office.
BEN (CONT'D)
Audrey... I didn't hear you come
in.
Audrey plops down sadly in a chair. Ben sits on the desk,
immediately suspicious.
BEN (CONT'D)
What is it this time?
AUDREY
Dad, are you ashamed of me?
BEN
Audrey, you're a...
(thinks better of total
honestly)
You're my daughter.
AUDREY
I've been thinking about what we
talked about the other night when
you were so mad.
BEN
It's not that I'm ashamed, Audrey,
it's just that I wish I could
depend on you more, especially
during a trying time like this.


AUDREY
That's what I want to talk to you
about. Dad, I want to change my
life. I've decided I want to help
you with the family business.
(she has his attention)
I mean, one of these days you're
going to need someone to take over.
Obviously, it's not going to be
Johnnie.
BEN
Audrey, I wish I could believe...
AUDREY
(starts to cry)
Daddy, please, I saw a friend that
I've known since childhood cut down
like a flower that had just begun
to bloom. Life can be so short.
There isn't all the time in the
world, I see that now. I want... to
change... my life.
BEN
(trying to stay skeptical)
How, exactly?
AUDREY
I don't need to go to college. You
can teach me the business, I'm
willing to start at the absolute
bottom.
BEN
Well, we've got some guests
arriving. You could go upstairs and
make some beds.
AUDREY
(tears again)
You still don't believe me-BEN
Alright, alright, alright. Where
would you start?
AUDREY
I think I should start at the
Department Store; cosmetics or
something. Part-time, at first,
'til I graduate.


Ben comes over to her. Beginning to accept this peace
offering.
BEN
You're really serious about this.
AUDREY
You have to start thinking about
the future, Daddy, just like I am.
BEN
Future?
AUDREY
Our family's future.
This strikes home with Ben. He considers. Wipes tears off
Audrey's cheek.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
Please, let me be your daughter

Ben hold his daughter by the shoulders. Stares into her eyes.

Truman gestures to Hawk, who leaves the room to retrieve the

COLE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
He's also determined the bites and
marks on her shoulders were made by
a parrot or a mynah bird.


COOPER
That narrows it down considerably.

That's it, you're up to date.

LEO
You don't like it, get somebody

Hank said you were gifted, I

Hey, I'm out ten thousand bucks,
maybe that's peanuts to you, not to

Leo uncovers a tarp revealing the dead body of BERNIE
RENAULT, wrapped in plastic.
LEO (CONT'D)
This is Bernie. Jacques' back in

LEO
I told him if he ever did I'd kill

Did he?
LEO
No. He shouldn't have trusted me,

One last chance, Leo. Don't

(hands over an envelope of
cash)
The rest on delivery. Not tomorrow
night. Not the night after. The
night after that. Three nights.
Green light. Clear enough?
Leo nods, lights a match off his thumbnail, lights Ben's
cigar.


LEO
Excuse me. I got to take Bernard
for a swim.
Leo hefts Bernard over a shoulder and walks off

EXT. WOODS CLEARING - NIGHT
Pitch dark. Then the beam of a flashlight cuts thru the
night, moving along the ground.
DONNA'S VOICE
But if Mrs. Palmer knows about the
necklace-JAMES' VOICE
How? How could she know?
Donna and James enter the clearing where they buried the
necklace. James lifts the rock.
DONNA
She said she saw it, she had a
vision and she said she saw
somebody take it.
JAMES
(digging, realizing)
Donna, it's not here.
DONNA
Then that means someone must have
seen us or followed us here...
JAMES
But how did Mrs. Palmer know?
DONNA
Laura used to say her mother was
kind of spooky, she used to see
stuff, she'd have dreams. Laura did
too.
An owl hoots. They move closer to one another.
JAMES
Maybe we should tell somebody.
DONNA
You mean the police?


JAMES
If it was the killer, then he knows
that we know
DONNA
James, the police didn't love
Laura. Nobody loved her but us.
JAMES
I don't want anything to happen to
you. I couldn't stand it, I
wouldn't be able to...
DONNA
(giving him strength)
Nothing is going to happen to me.
JAMES
Just a few days ago we were so
happy. I keep thinking I'm going to
see her, I think I catch a glimpse
of her out of the corner of my eye,
sometimes it's like I really see
her, at school or the Diner...
James looks away, she takes him by the shoulders.
DONNA
James, look at me... we're gonna
find out who killed her. This is
about us. We have to do this for
us, not just for her.
(they kiss)
I want to be with you...
They kiss again, more passionately.

Hello, Pete, how did the shift go?
PETE

Cut some wood, made some lumber.
I'm so tired I could...
JOSIE
...eat a horse? I made you a turkey
sandwich.
Pete goes through the mail as Josie retrieves the sandwich
and unwraps it.


PETE
Fantastic, Josie. Is Catherine
asleep?
JOSIE
Yes.
PETE
Then gimme some mayo with that.
Josie smiles and gets out the mayo. Pete heavily lathers his
sandwich.
PETE (CONT'D)
Josie, how do you feel about fish?
JOSIE
To eat?
PETE
To catch. The Fishing Association's
annual 'do is coming up, you know,
I'm the defending champion-(takes a big bite of
sandwich, as Josie goes
through her mail)
--and this year they're adding a
Mixed Doubles Division and I
thought, if you're interested, what
the heck, would you like to partner
up with me?
JOSIE
Pete, I don't know the first step
about fishing.
PETE
Josie, there's enough fishing in me
for both of us.
A letter, has captured Josie's interest. She doesn't respond.
PETE (CONT'D)
So, what do you think?
JOSIE
Sure, Pete. Let's give it a run at

PETE
Josie, you're my kind'a gal. I'm

INT. GREAT NORTHERN DALE COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Through the walls from adjacent rooms we hear whooping and
hollering, a blowing of horns and ratcheting noise makers.
It sounds like a rodeo in Times Square on New Year's Eve.
DALE COOPER sits up in bed, distraught, sleepless. From the
bedside table, he picks up his watch and tape recorder.

COOPER
Diane, it's 4:28 a.m., I've just
been woken up by the most god-awful
racket, which you can probably hear
over the sound of my voice...
(holds up the recorder
to capture the sound)
Can you hear that?
(holds it up again)
I've experienced nothing at the Great
Northern up until this moment but
the most pleasant, courteous service
imaginable, but this only goes to
prove the point that the minute a
traveler leaves home he loses almost
100% of his ability to control his
environment. Diane, I'm wondering if
you could overnight express to me
two pair of those Ear-Pillow Silicon
Ear Plugs I used the last time I had
to visit New York. Naturally I didn't
bring them with me on this trip
because I didn't think they'd be
necessary...

He holds the recorder up again.

CUT TO:

INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY

Dale Cooper, dressed and slightly bleary-eyed, enters and
takes the corner table. Off screen, through a door to a
private dining room, we HEAR a rowdy group of about twelve
men and women singing a bawdy Icelandic drinking song. Harried
WAITRESSES come and go out of the room, bearing huge platters
of food. TRUDY approaches Cooper.

TRUDY
(reaching Cooper)
Coffee?

COOPER
Please.
(she pours)
What's with the choir practice?

TRUDY
Business junket. From Iceland. Got
in about three this morning.

COOPER
They're on my floor.

TRUDY
Lucky you.

COOPER
It'll take them a day or so to reset
their biological clocks.

WAITRESS
Hope the herring holds out.

He holds out his cup for a refill. She pours. The Icelanders
start another song

AUDREY HORNE enters, looking for Cooper, brightens, moves to
his table.

AUDREY
How are you?

COOPER
To be perfectly honest, Audrey, I'm
tired and a little on edge.

AUDREY
(sits, saddened)
Oh.
(hoping for approval)
I got a job.

COOPER
That's excellent--

AUDREY
And I thought maybe now I could help
you with your case, guess where I'm--

COOPER
(finishing, rising)
You'll have to excuse me, Audrey,
I'm running late this morning, I
only have time for coffee.

AUDREY
Maybe I could go with you.

COOPER
(leaving change, taking
receipt)
Thursdays were traditionally a school
day when I was your age.

AUDREY
I can't believe you were ever my
age.

COOPER
I've got the pictures to prove it.
See you later, Audrey.

AUDREY
See you later. Bye.

She wistfully watches him go. Digs her nails into her palms.
The Icelandic group finishes another song and roars with
laughter. JERRY HORNE enters from the private dining room,
carrying a small suitcase, laughing, along with the head
Icelander, EINER THORSON. Jerry claps Einer on the back,
they shake hands and embrace and say something in Icelandic.
Jerry turns back to the room and yells to the Icelanders
inside...

JERRY
My brother is going to love you guys!

Jerry exits the dining room.

CUT TO:

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

BEN HORNE is behind his desk when Jerry hurries in with his
bag.

JERRY
I bring you greetings from the
fertile, treeless tundra of Iceland!
Brother Ben, there aren't two twigs
to rub together on the whole island -
wait'll these guys get a load of the
woods!

BEN
By six this morning we had complaints
from nearly every guest in the hotel,
what are they on, nitrous oxide?

JERRY
I have had more serious fun in two
days with these nordic animals and
Ben, I'm in love, her name is Heba,
she's a giant snow queen with a smile
like sunrise on a ice floe, you could
go blind looking at this girl--look
at this.
(takes a large package
out of his bag)
You see what she gave me? An entire
leg lamb!
(unwraps it; huge and
slightly grotesque)
Is that beautiful? Chunk some garlic
in there, some crushed mint:
rotisserie heaven--come on, you got
to meet her--

BEN
Let 'em sack out for a few hours
first, now have they approved our
proposal?

TERRY
(refers to the
Ghostwood project
map)
Ben, hip pocket, glasnost on ice,
they are insane for Ghostwood Estates.
We're on the plane, they're begging
me, "Jerry, please, let us write the
check--you fill in the blanks."

BEN
Let's not be eager beavers until the
ink's dry. You grab some down time.
We've laid in a a gala reception for
your fair-haired boys tonight--all
of Twin Peaks best and brightest--

JERRY
'We holding it in a phone booth?

BEN
--and if we still need a kicker to
nail the sale I'm thinking maybe
they might enjoy a road trip up to
you-know-where.
(holds a hand over
one eye)

JERRY
Jacks!

LELAND'S VOICE
B-b-ben?

A haggard, unshaven LELAND PALMER is standing in the doorway.

BEN
Leland, what are you doing here?

LELAND
I know the new investment group is
arriving today... if there's anything
I can do...

BEN
Leland, the best thing you can do
right now is follow the doctor's
orders and go home, you need your
rest--

LELAND
I just feel... I just feel I need
something, I need something to... to
occupy my mind...
(close to tears)

JERRY
(gestures behind
Leland's back)
Check-out time.

BEN
Take some time off, for god's sake,
fly somewhere, take Sarah--

LELAND
(unraveling)
I'm afraid to go...

He crumbles into a chair. From the hallway, we hear the voices
of approaching ICELANDERS, singing another ribald song. Jerry
nimbly moves to the door and quietly shuts it. Ben tries to
hush Leland's sobs. The singers continue singing, directly
outside the door now. Then they move on... Ben and Jerry
breathe a sigh of relief. Ben points at Leland, then sticks
up his thumb, "get this guy out of here."

INT. JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT - DAY

Cooper enters the apartment and is met by SHERIFF HARRY
TRUMAN, who is supervising the investigation of the apartment.
TROOPERS and two FORENSIC COPS in plain clothes are working.
DOC HAYWARD is on the phone.

TRUMAN
Morning.

COOPER
What've we got, Harry?

TRUMAN
Jacques Renault's a Canadian national,
worked the local lumber fields until
he put on a little excess tonnage a
couple seasons ago. That's when he
started tending bar at the Roadhouse.

COOPER
Do you have any doughnuts here?

TRUMAN
Andy?

Gestures "doughnut", points to Cooper, to ANDY, who nods and
starts out.

COOPER
Better wash that down with a cup of
joe, I didn't sleep too well last
night.

TRUMAN
(gestures "coffee" to
Andy before he exits)
You're looking a little peaked.

COOPER
There's a large group of insane men
staying on my floor. Where is Jacques
Renault, Harry?

TRUMAN
No one's seen him for two days. We've
canvassed the building and the
Roadhouse, I sent Hawk to roust his
brother but it looks like Bernie
skipped bail; no sign.

Cooper looks up at a ceiling light fixture, as Doc Hayward
hangs up the phone and crosses to them.

HAYWARD
Morning, Agent Cooper.

COOPER
(still looking up)
Doc.

HAYWARD
The blood on that shirt you found
here is AB negative. It's not Laura's
blood.

COOPER
So that was Jacques Renault's blood
on Leo Johnson's shirt.

Truman and Doc look at each other. Doc goes back to the phone
and dials. Andy returns with Cooper's coffee and doughnut.
Cooper takes them, still looking up.

COOPER
Thank you, Andy.
(takes a bite and a
sip)
Could you hold these for a second?

He hands the coffee and doughnut back to Andy, looks up again.

COOPER
Where's Leo Johnson, Harry?

TRUMAN
The APB went out last night, nothing
yet.

COOPER
Give me a leg up here, would you
Harry?

Truman cradles his hands, Cooper takes out a pair of calipers,
steps into the cradle and Truman boosts his up and out of
frame. Doc Hayward hangs up the phone and returns.

HAYWARD
Jacques Renault's blood is AB
negative.

COOPER
(out of frame)
Thank you, Doc.

Cooper comes back down into frame, gingerly holding a dusty
copy of "FLESH WORLD" Magazine in the calipers. He sets it
down on a table, blows off some dust and turns pages with
the calipers.

TRUMAN
"Flesh World" again.

COOPER
Harry, remember this ad with the
picture of Ronette Pulaski?

He turns to the page in question. There's an opened envelope
between the pages, with a letter inside. Cooper carefully
removes the envelope.

TRUMAN
We traced that ad. Came into the
magazine in a plain envelope, no
name--

COOPER
Here's how it works. The magazine's
a clearing house. Readers write
letters in response to ads and send
them into the magazine, then the
magazine mails those letters on to
the advertiser. No direct contact.
(shows him the envelope)
Ronette received her letters at this
P.O. Box.

TRUMAN
That's a local zip code.

COOPER
My guess is this P.O. box will be
registered in the name of Jacques
Renault. Let's see who was writing
to Ronette. Post marked Georgia.

He takes out the letter. There are a couple of snapshots
inside as well. Cooper, Truman and Doc look at the snapshots.

HAYWARD
Good night.

TRUMAN
That guy's no Georgia peach.

COOPER
Somehow the beard ruins the effect
of the lingerie, don't you think?
(scans the letter)
Poor bastard.
(folds it up, goes
back to the magazine)
By the way, Harry, did you happen to
notice the picture of Leo Johnson
and his truck on this page?

Points to the picture of a silver truck cab which we saw
before.

INT. JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY

SHELLY JOHNSON is serving a hot breakfast to BOBBY BRIGGS.
He's dressed, she's in a robe. She sets the plate down in
front of him. He eats ravenously.

BOBBY
I love when you cook for me.

SHELLY
Leo hates my cooking.

BOBBY
Leo has missed the boat with you,
baby. The biggest mistake of your
life was dropping out of the eleventh
grade and marrying that roadhog.

SHELLY
(amused and excited)
What would you do if he walked in
right now?

BOBBY
(a hot look)
Come here.
(pats his leg)
Come  here.

She sits on his leg. He hugs her, kisses her neck, looks up,
mock surprise.

BOBBY
Hey, Leo, how's it going, man? What
a surprise!

With a big smile he draws Shelly's nickel-plated revolver
out of the pocket of her robe and points it at the imaginary
Leo.

BOBBY
Now, Leo, Shelly tells me you don't
like her cooking. Tell you what, she
and I, we're going to sit here while
you cook breakfast for us, you
scumbag, and if you so much as say
one harsh word to this beautiful
girl, I'm going to shoot your ugly
face off. Okay, Leo?

He smiles. Shelly laughs. They hear a car drive up outside.
Bobby looks out the window.

BOBBY
Sheriff's deputy. Shelly, you tell
him exactly what I told you to, just
like we talked about, okay?

SHELLY
Okay.

The doorbell rings. Bobby kisses her, she goes to the door.
Bobby takes the gun and conceals himself in a room off the
kitchen. We hear voices.

SHELLY'S VOICE
Hi... sure, come on in.

INTERCUT:

BOBBY'S POV

The living room. Shelly is talking to Deputy Andy Brennan.

ANDY
Do you know when Leo might be back?

SHELLY
Sorry, he never tells me where he's
going.

She lights a smoke and sneaks a look back at Bobby. She winks.
Bobby smiles.

SHELLY
They called and said you were looking
for him, is Leo in some kind of
trouble?

ANDY
(looking into the
kitchen)
We just need to talk to him.

SHELLY
This isn't about Laura or anything
is it?

ANDY
Why do you say that?

SHELLY
Well, I don't know. I did hear him
talking to this guy the night he
left--

ANDY
Which guy?

SHELLY
This guy Jacques Renault? They were
outside by Leo's truck, I could hear
'em, from over in the kitchen--

ANDY
What did they say?

SHELLY
I couldn't hear exactly. They were
arguing but I did hear them mention
her name, then they took off together.

ANDY
Shelly, you call us the minute he
gets in touch with you, you be careful
of Leo--

SHELLY
You don't have to tell me that twice.
Thanks for stopping by, Andy.

They move back to the door. Bobby puts the gun in his pocket.
Shelly comes back to the kitchen, Bobby grabs her and kisses
her passionately.

SHELLY
How'd I do?

BOBBY
You were great. God, you drive me
crazy.

The phone rings. Twice. Shelly answers, as Bobby still kisses
her.

SHELLY
Hello?... hey, Leo, where you calling
from?

Bobby stops pawing her, gives her another signal. She
responds.

SHELLY
What's that? Is anybody looking for
you?
(Bobby shakes his
head)
Leo, what would anybody be looking
for you for?...
(Bobby nods,
encouraging her to
continue)
Leo, you know how paranoid you get
when you've been popping bennies on
the road a couple days... so, when
you coming home?

Bobby slips the gun into her hand. She looks at it, looks at
Bobby.

SHELLY
Everything's fine, come on home,
Leo... I miss you, too.

She hangs up. Looks at the gun.

takes notice.

JAMES
Mom came home yesterday.

ED
(nods)
She in bad shape?

JAMES
It's getting worse; every time she
goes off on a drunk now, I half expect
her to turn up dead. And part of
me's thinking there's worse things
that could happen.

ED
Those are hard thoughts.

JAMES
(almost overcome with
emotion)
God, I'm... so ashamed of her.

ED
That doesn't mean we give up. We
have to keep trying.

JAMES
What's left to do? Talk about it
some more? She won't get help, she
won't listen to either one of us--

ED
I don't know what else we can do--

JAMES
She's killing herself... I don't
want to hate her, Ed, but if she
won't let us help her sometimes I
think it'd be better if she'd just
get it over with...

His tears finally come. Ed hugs him.

ED
I know it's rough. But if we give up
on her, who else is gonna give a
damn?

A car pulls up out front; we hear it trip the bell wires
near the pumps.

JAMES
(pulling away, trying
to make light)
...been kind of a rough week.

He goes out to the back. STAY WITH Ed. We hear a car door
open and close. Norma comes into the shop. Too many secrets
to rush into each other's arms.

ED
Hey, good lookin'.

NORMA
I hope you don't mind my coming.

ED
No, no, Nadine won't be back from
that patent attorney over in Fairvale
for hours.

NORMA
The famous silent drape runners.

ED
She's already spending the millions.

NORMA
Anyway, I have to put gas in my car
like everybody else, right?

ED
Right.

Pause. Their smiles fade.

NORMA
I didn't want to tell you over the
phone. Hank got his parole.

ED
Okay.

NORMA
He's coming home, I mean back and
I... haven't said anything to him,
yet, I--

ED
Hey, you don't have to explain.

NORMA
I only saw him for a minute before
we went into the hearing and he seemed
so hopeful, it just didn't seem like
the right time--

ED
I understand.

NORMA
(Pause)
Have you said anything to Nadine?

ED
(trying not to lie)
I haven't yet, Norma.

NORMA
(half-joking)
Waiting for me to go first?

ED
No. It's just, the more I think
about... Norma, Nadine's not a well
woman.

NORMA
What are you saying?

ED
I don't know, darling--

NORMA
(painfully realizing,
pulling back)
I think I do.

ED
Maybe the time isn't right, for either
of us right now

NORMA
We've only had to wait twenty years,
what's a few more? We can always
hold hands in the nursing home.
(almost laughs as she
fights off her tears)

ED
I don't ever want to hurt you, Norma.

NORMA
Maybe that's our trouble, Ed, we
never want to hurt anybody. We never
just take what we want. But part of
me's beginning to think that's how
you get to the end of your life and
don't have anything to slow for it?

ED
Norma...

NORMA
(trying desperately
not to cry)
Don't call me. Not for a while, okay?

ED
All right.

NORMA
I love you, Ed.

She goes. He watches.

Audrey Home is ushered through the doors and directed to sit
across the desk by EMORY BATTIS, the department store's forty-
year old Director of Personnel.

BATTIS
Please, please, come in, sit, sit,
can I get you something to drink,
Miss Horne, coffee?

AUDREY
Audrey. Call me Audrey. Nothing,
thank you.

BATTIS
Audrey, yes, well, call me Emory.
(an admiring gaze)
My, my, I can remember when your
father used to bring you down here
when you were just a little girl--

AUDREY
Did you used to bounce me on your
knee, Emory?

BATTIS
(a coughing fit)
Doesn't the time just fly right by--

AUDREY
(has him pegged; a
turkey)
So did my father speak to you?

BATTIS
Yes, yes he did, and I can't tell
you how excited we are, Audrey, that
you want to come on board and put in
a hitch with us down here at our
flagship--

AUDREY
Thank you--

BATTIS
You know, here at Horne's Department
Store we carry on a fifty year
tradition, offering the Northwest's
most elegant shopping experience,
with the widest variety of merchandise
and the friendliest, most courteous
service.

AUDREY
Save it for the customers, Emory.

BATTIS
(blinks)
Excuse me?

AUDREY
You don't exactly have to "sell" me
on the place, do you?

BATTIS
(nervous laugh)
I see your point, indeed I don't, no
siree--

AUDREY
(preening)
So... what did you have in mind for
me?

BATTIS
(looks, then nervously
consults notes)
Let's see, let's see, I suppose
driving a delivery truck is out of
the question--
(laughs politely, she
pretends to)
Well Audrey, per your father's
suggestion, starting low, aiming
high, etc... we thought perhaps the
wrapping department.

AUDREY
Wrapping?

BATTIS
Boxes, gifts, etc, etc. Part time,
after school.

AUDREY
No, no, no, no; Emory, ix-nay on the
oxes-bay.

BATTIS
Certainly not the most glamorous job
in the store, but then your father
did specify--

AUDREY
Emory, may I speak frankly?

BATTIS
Oh please do.

AUDREY
Let's talk retail.

BATTIS
Sales?

AUDREY
Perfume.

A slight tremor runs across his features. She picks up on
it.

BATTIS
One of our more sensitive areas.
Expensive items, delicate customer
relations--

AUDREY
I'm afraid I've got my heart set on
it.

BATTIS
(more than reluctant)
I'd have to speak to your father--

AUDREY
Emory, here's what we're going to
do. You're going to to tell my father
I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes
down with the drones and then you're
going to put me to work behind the
perfume counter this afternoon--
(before he can speak)
--because if you don't I'm going to
rip my sweater in half and scream at
the top of my lungs and tell my father
you made a pass at me. Does that
help clear things up for you? Emory?

She grabs her sweater, ready to rip and scream.

BATTIS
Yes. Yes.

AUDREY
(knows what he needs)
Yes what?

BATTIS
Yes, Ms. Horne.

She sits back down, demurely arranges herself and smiles.

AUDREY

He turns, sees her, they embrace.

DONNA
I got your note
(he still holds her)
Are you all right?

JAMES
Donna, there's a few things I gotta
say.

DONNA
What?

JAMES
(extremely difficult
for him)
I told you my Dad died when I was
ten?... He didn't die. We were living
in San Francisco. He was a musician.
He was a bum and he ran off and he
left us, me and my mom.

DONNA
I'm sorry.

JAMES
(a rush of intensity)
My mom grew up out here. That's why
we moved back. My mom was a writer,
she was good, poems, short stories.
She's an alcoholic.
(looks at her)
If you have a problem with this, I
know you didn't ask to hear it...

DONNA
I don't have a problem. You tell me.

JAMES
It's true she was out of town this
week, but she wasn't traveling. What
she does is, she goes to another
town, shacks up in some cheap hotel
room with a couple bottles and picks
up guys and...

He's too ashamed to continue. She holds him.

DONNA
It's all right.

JAMES
I'm telling you this because I don't
want to have any secrets from you, I
don't want there to be any lies
between us. It's the secrets people
keep that destroy any chance they
have for happiness and I don't want
us to be like that...

DONNA
We won't. We won't be.

He kisses her, they hold on to each other.

JAMES
We have to do what's right. What you
said yesterday was true; if we don't
do everything we can to figure out
what happened to Laura it'll never
go away, our whole lives--

DONNA
We will, James.

JAMES
She's out there, wandering like a
restless spirit--

DONNA
I feel it, too. We owe it to her.

JAMES
(searingly honest)
And we owe it to ourselves or else
somehow, someday Donna, she's going
to come between us.

DONNA
What can we do?

JAMES
I've got an idea. Laura's cousin,
this girl Madeleine, I talked to her
yesterday, I think she could help
us. I want to ask her to meet us at
the diner today, is that alright?

DONNA
Yes.

He kisses her, ready to move off, she stops him, looks him
in the eye, strong.

DONNA
Count on me, James. No secrets.

He smiles, kisses her again and runs off to his bike, parked
nearby. She watches him go.

CUT TO:

INT. JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT/CORRIDOR - DAY

CLOSE on a plate of doughnuts as they're passed among the
cops working at the scene. STAY WITH Dale Cooper as he takes
one and grabs a bite as he looks through some drawers in the
kitchen. He's wearing surgical gloves. He takes a bill out
of the drawer, lays it thoughtfully on the counter. He opens
a cabinet; a red-and-black plaid shirt hangs inside. A number
of postcards and photographs are thumbtacked to the inside
of the door.

DEPUTY HAWK arrives, hands a packet of letters to Truman,
they cross to Cooper.

HAWK
That P.O. box was registered to
Jacques Renault.

COOPER
(looking at the letters)
These are all from people responding
to Ronette's ad in the magazine.
(look at Cooper)
Maybe there's something from someone
we know.

TRUMAN
(bothered)
There better not be.

COOPER
(noticing something)
Hawk, hand me that magazine again,
would you?

Hawk does. Cooper pages through, looking for something.

TRUMAN
What is it?

COOPER
Those letters are addressed to two
different ad numbers, Ronette's and
another one... here it is.

Cooper finds the second ad in the magazine.

COOPER
(reading)
"Young student requires instruction
in the ways of love. Only generous,
mature men need apply."

INTERCUT:

THE MAGAZINE

The ad features a color photograph of a girl in lingerie,
suggestively posed in front of dark red drapes. Her head has
been cropped from the photo.

ON COOPER AND TRUMAN

Cooper whips out his magnifying glass and examines the photo.

COOPER
It's Laura.

TRUMAN
You see some distinguishing mark?

COOPER
The drapes.

TRUMAN
Drapes?

Cooper opens the cabinet, points to a color photo pinned to
the door of a small log cabin in the woods, hands the
magnifying glass to Harry. He looks through it at the photo...

INTERCUT:

PHOTOGRAPH OF LOG CABIN

Through the magnifying glass, red drapes are visible in the
windows.

ON COOPER AND TRUMAN

COOPER
Red drapes. From my dream, Harry.
(he picks up the bill
he set aside)
Can you think of a good reason why
an apartment dweller like Jacques
would buy fifty gallons of heating
oil?

TRUMAN
To heat a log cabin?

HAWK
Jacques brother mentioned something
about a place up near state line.

COOPER
Pack a lunch, fellas. We're going to
take a walk in the woods.

OFF the cropped photo of Laura in the magazine...

CUT TO:

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

Laura's cousin, MADELEINE FERGUSON enters, looks around.
James and Donna are seated at a booth.

JAMES
Madeleine?

She sees them, smiles, crosses over. James rises. Madeleine
sits across from them. There's a MAN sitting alone in the
next booth, his back to them.

MADELEINE
Hi. Hi.

DONNA
Hi, I'm Donna Hayward.

MADELEINE
My friends call me Maddy. This is
really nice of you guys. I don't
really know anybody in town except
Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland. And the
mood at the house, you can probably
guess, isn't so great right now.

Donna and James look at each other. James nods.

JAMES
Maddy, would you like something to
drink?

MADELEINE
A cherry coke would be great.

JAMES
You got it.

James gets up, goes to the counter.

DONNA
Madeleine, what we wanted to talk to
you about... if I said you can't,
really say a word of this to anybody
else, not a soul, not even your aunt
or uncle, would that be okay with
you?

MADELEINE
(lightly)
Sounds like some big secret.

DONNA
It is. Madeleine, James and I knew
Laura better than anyone. She was in
some kind of terrible trouble before
she died, worse than any of us could
imagine--

MADELEINE
(eyes widening)
What?

James returns with her drink, sits.

DONNA
I'd rather not say too much about
things we can't prove yet.

JAMES
In some ways, the less you know about
it the better.

MADELEINE
You said you can't prove it "yet."

DONNA
We loved Laura. We're afraid the
truth might never come out or that
the person who killed her might never
be caught. We've sworn on her memory
not to let that happen.

MADELEINE
...my God. You know who did it?

JAMES
We have some ideas.

DONNA
We wanted to talk to you because we
need your help.

MADELEINE
What do you want me to do?

DONNA
Laura used to talk about a hiding
place she had, somewhere in her house,
maybe her room, I'm not sure. Nobody
else knew about it. We think she may
have left something there that could
lead us to the killer.

Pause.

MADELEINE
I'll help you.

DONNA
You will?

MADELEINE
Absolutely.

JAMES
That's great.

MADELEINE
You know, I didn't really know Laura
that well, but I feel like I do, our
folks were always telling us how
much alike we were...

As she speaks, CAMERA MOVES around and behind to the next
booth to reveal the Man sitting with his back to them: it's
HANK JENNINGS. He's heard the entire conversation. He takes
a slow sip of coffee. He's fingering his domino key chain.

James, Donna and Madeleine rise and start out.

DONNA
Will you call me if there's anything
I can do?

MADELEINE
I don't think there'll be any problem

JAMES
Madeleine, this is really great.

MADELEINE
Call me Maddy.

They're out the door. Hank smiles. A few moments later, Shelly
and Norma enter, all dolled up from the beauty parlor,
laughing.

SHELLY
--God, we look like a couple of
refugee beauty queens.

NORMA
Shelly, I don't think you know how
good looking you really are.

SHELLY
I sure never felt so glamorous, hope
I don't chip a nail slinging these
plates around--

They laugh. They pass Hank's booth on the way back to the
kitchen.

HANK
Hello, Norma.

She turns and sees him, stops dead.

NORMA
Hank...

HANK
You look beautiful. You go to
Natasha's?
(she nods, can't speak)
Surprised to see me?

NORMA
Yes.

HANK
Got out a day early. Model prisoners
get all the breaks.

Norma looks at Shelly, who starts back to the kitchen.

HANK
Is that Leo's girl?

NORMA
Wife.

HANK
That Leo. So impulsive.
(a friendly remark)
Not much meat on her.
(a long look)
I don't expect a kiss or anything.
Figure I have to earn my way back
into your heart, Norma. But I intend
to try.
(another look)
So, where do I start?  I'll wash
dishes. Maybe work my way up to short
order one of these days?

NORMA
Washing dishes would be fine.

HANK
Can I finish my coffee first, boss?

He smiles and sips his coffee. They look at each other.

SHELLY

In the kitchen, looking out at them. The TV is on the kitchen,
but the sound is off.

CUT TO:

THE TELEVISION

A silent scene from "Invitation to Love." MONTANA grabs CHET
by the lapels, yells at him, slaps him twice and pushes him
to the ground. Chet tries to rise.

A high-heeled shoe steps onto Chet's chest, pushing him back
down. EMERALD. She laughs at him, throws herself in Montana's
arms. They kiss.

Chet looks up at them, stricken. Montana laughs.

ACT THREE

FADE IN:

INT. DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - DAY

We don't immediately realize where we are. Seated in a half
circle of chairs are MAJOR BRIGGS, MRS. BRIGGS and Bobby,
who can't believe what he's hearing.

MRS. BRIGGS
He's been spending more and more of
his time alone in his room.

MAJOR BRIGGS
It's become much more difficult to
engage him in conversation.

MRS. BRIGGS
Terrible mood swings.

MAJOR BRIGGS
We've been told by the school that
his attendance has become erratic at
best.

MRS. BRIGGS
And of course the recent trouble
with public fighting. Both at the
Roadhouse and the funeral.

And now we see who they're talking to, sitting in a leather
chair, nodding sagely...

DR. JACOBY
Are you using drugs, Bobby?

BOBBY
No I'm not.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Alcohol.

MRS. BRIGGS
Alcohol's a drug.

BOBBY
That's not what he meant.

MRS. BRIGGS
Alcohol doesn't count?

BOBBY
Everybody uses alcohol.

DR. JACOBY
Are you unhappy, Bobby?

BOBBY
Shouldn't I be?

DR. JACOBY
That's not for me to say.

Pause.

BOBBY
Have you ever killed anybody?

DR. JACOBY
Have you?

BOBBY
My father has.

MAJOR BRIGGS
During wartime.

MRS. BRIGGS
That's different.

BOBBY
Different from what?

DR. JACOBY
Perhaps I should spend a few minutes
with Robert alone.

MAJOR BRIGGS
This is supposed to be family
counseling.

DR. JACOBY
And I'll need to spend some time
alone with every member of the family.
Bobby first.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Fair enough.

MRS. BRIGGS
Whatever you think best, Doctor.

The Major and the Missus get up and leave the room.

DR. JACOBY
Bobby, let's cut the crap.
(Bobby looks at him)
Do you feel that your parents don't
understand what you're going through?

BOBBY
That's a good one.

DR. JACOBY
Let's talk about Laura.

BOBBY
Okay. Let's talk about Laura.

DR. JACOBY
(knows some secrets
here)
What happened the first time you and
Laura made love?

BOBBY
What the hell kind of question is
that?

DR. JACOBY
Bobby... did you cry?

BOBBY
(stunned; this is
true)
Did I what?

DR. JACOBY
(also true)
What did Laura do then? Did she laugh
at you?

Bobby's completely throw off his guard. Jacoby moves in.

DR. JACOBY
Were you sad when Laura died?

BOBBY
Laura wanted to die.

DR. JACOBY
How do you know that?

BOBBY
(rising emotion)
Because she told me.

DR. JACOBY
What else did she tell you?
(silence)
Did she tell you there was no goodness
in the world?

BOBBY
She said people tried to be good but
they were really sick and rotten,
her most of all, and the harder she
tried to be good the more rotten she
felt because it didn't mean anything,
because every time she tried to help
the world be a better place something
terrible came up inside her and pulled
her back down into hell, it took her
deeper and deeper into the blackest
nightmare and every time it got harder
to go back up to the light.

Pause.

DR. JACOBY
(on the case)
Did you sometimes have the feeling
that Laura was harboring some awful
secret?

BOBBY
Yes.

DR. JACOBY
Bad enough that she wanted to die
because of it?

BOBBY
Yes.

DR. JACOBY
Bad enough that it drove her to
consciously try to find people's
weaknesses and prey on them, tempt
them, break them down, make them do
terrible, degrading things?

BOBBY
(shocked and frightened)
Yes.

DR. JACOBY
Laura wanted to corrupt people,
because that's how she felt about
herself--

BOBBY
(near tears)
Yes.

Pause.

DR. JACOBY
Is that what happened to you, Bobby?

Bobby dissolves into tears.

DR. JACOBY
(gently)
Is that what Laura did to you?

BOBBY
Yes. She made me... she wanted... so
much... she made me sell drugs so
she could have them... she made me...

Bobby can't continue, buries his face in his hands. Jacoby
has had something essential confirmed. He rises, pats Bobby
sympathetically on the shoulder, offers him the bowl of...

DR. JACOBY
Malted milk ball?

Bobby shakes his head. Jacoby pops one in his mouth and chews,
thinking.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A dense, dark forest.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A number of police cars parked in a clearing, the jumping
off place for a search party. Cooper, Truman, Hawk and Doc
Hayward. They're preparing to go off into the woods, when
Andy speeds up in his patrol car and gets out.

ANDY
(excited)
Sheriff, Leo Johnson's been gone two
days, his wife hasn't seen him--

TRUMAN
Okay, Andy--

ANDY
But the thing is, I looked into the
kitchen? She was having breakfast
and the table was set for two.

COOPER
Good work, Andy. You keep those eyes
peeled.

Andy beams with pride.

TRUMAN
Andy, I want you to stay with the
cars.
(Andy's disappointed)
I need someone to stay near the radio.
We'll keep in touch on the walkies.

Andy nods and starts back to the cars.

TRUMAN
Hawk, lead the way.

Hawk tunes up his sensory apparatus, nods, starts into the
woods. Cooper and Truman look at each other. Cooper nods.

TRUMAN
Doc, you sure you're up for this?

HAYWARD
In for a penny, in for a pound, Harry.

TRUMAN
That's the spirit.

They follow Hawk into the woods.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A dark, dark grove. The air still and moist. A solitary
mournful bird call. Hawk stops, listens, examines the ground,
finds something that leads him on. Cooper, Truman and Hayward
follow.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Hawk turns a corner and comes upon a simple, solidly
constructed log cabin in a clearing. It is not the cabin we
saw in the photograph in Jacques' apartment. Smoke rises
from the chimney. The others join Hawk in the clearing.

COOPER
Not the one we're looking for.

HAWK
Maybe, maybe not.

TRUMAN
You might want to hang back a step,
Doc.

HAYWARD
(winded)
Might want to anyway.

As a precaution, Hawk and Truman draw weapons and along with
Cooper start to advance. As they round the corner of the
cabin, they come face to face with the LOG LADY, carrying a
log.

TRUMAN
Hello.

LOG LADY
About time you got here.
(to herself)
They move so slowly when they're not
afraid.

She goes right inside the cabin. Pause. They look at each
other. The Log Lady appears in the doorway again.

LOG LADY
Come on then. My log does not judge,
it only records.

She disappears again. They look at each other. Cooper nods.
Truman calls back.

TRUMAN
Doc?

CUT TO:

INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Truman, Cooper, Hawk and then Doc enter. One large room.
Simple kitchen, a bed in the corner. Table with six chairs,
six places with a log-motif tea setting. A boarded up
fireplace. Fire extinguishers and a bucket of water in each
corner. An axe, a saw and other woodcutting tools. Framed
picture of a lumberjack, on the mantle, beside a funereal
urn, with ashes. Log Lady goes to the kitchen, where she's
preparing tea.

LOG LADY
I've got tea. I've got cookies. No
cake.

COOPER
That's very kind of you, but I don't
know if we have time to--

Hawk signals him to accept the invitation, then takes the
lead and sits at the table.

HAWK
What kind of cookies?

LOG LADY
Sugar. The owls won't see us in here.

Hayward sits at the table beside Hawk.

HAYWARD
Some tea would be very nice.

LOG LADY
(to Truman and Cooper,
annoyed)
Shut your eyes and you will burst
into flames.

TRUMAN
Thank you.

COOPER
Thank you very much.

Truman and Cooper sit. The Log Lady sets down a plate of
cookies on the table, along with a log-motif tea pot, then
she takes a seat.

LOG LADY
We'll let it steep.

Pause. Cooper reaches for a cookie. Log Lady lightly slaps
his hand.

LOG LADY
Wait for the tea. The fish aren't
running.

Cooper. looks around, noticing all the firefighting equipment.
She looks at him, as if to say, "Don't laugh. I see everything
and it takes it's toll." Pause.

COOPER
Do you use fire for cooking then?

LOG LADY
I go to great lengths to keep it
under control.

TRUMAN
M'am, were you expecting us?

LOG LADY
You're two days late. Clues may be
as cold as the tea but that's your
concern.
(pause)
My log saw something, something
significant. There's no closer
relationship than the logger with
the tree.

Pause. Cooper looks at Truman.

TRUMAN
M'am, what did your log see?

LOG LADY
(shakes her head)
Drink first and be ready for the
truth..

She checks the pot, decides it's ready and starts to pour.
Six cups. Formal manners.

COOPER
(passing the plate
around)
Lime, Harry?

LOG LADY
My husband was a logging man.

COOPER
Oh?

LOG LADY
He met the devil. The devil took the
form of fire. Fire is the devil hiding
like a coward in the smoke.

HAYWARD
(he knows her)
The day after the wedding, wasn't it
Margaret?

She looks away.

HAWK
(to the Log Lady,
comforting)
The wood holds many spirits, doesn't
it Margaret?

She nods. Pause. They nibble on cookies and drink their tea.
The Log Lady turns to Cooper.

LOG LADY
You can ask it now.

COOPER
(to the log; solemnly,
respectfully)
What did you see that night? The
night Laura Palmer, was killed?

LOG LADY
(pause to the log)
Shhhh. Let me do the talking.
(she closes her eyes;
this is hard for her)
Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying.
Many things were blocked. Laughing.
Two men. Two girls. Flashlights, in
the woods, pass by, over the ridge.
The owls were near. The dark was
pressing in on her...
(calmer)
Quiet then. A gentle wind. Footsteps,
later, one man pass by. All quiet.
Screams, far away. Terrible. Terrible.
One voice...

COOPER
(quietly)
Man or girl?

LOG LADY
Girl... Further up. Over the ridge
The owl were silent.

She opens her eyes, blinks. Takes a sip of tea. Hayward dries
the tears in his eyes.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS DAY

A light mist falls. Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward make
their way up the ridge through thick woods.

COOPER
The two girls are Laura and Ronette.

TRUMAN
The two men Jacques, maybe Leo?

COOPER
Maybe.

TRUMAN
Who's the third man?

Hawk stops suddenly, gestures them to be quiet. He listens.

HAWK
Do you hear it?

They listen... Far away... music. An angelic voice, soft
chords.

HAWK
This way.

They continue on.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS SECOND CABIN - DAY

Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward emerge from a thick stand
into a clearing; on a rocky point above them stands the log
cabin seen in the photo at Jacques; apartment. Rundown, not
well maintained. Red drapes are visible in a window. Cooper
looks at the photo. It was shot from the angle they're viewing
it from now.

The music issues from inside the cabin. The song ends. Pause.
The same song begins again.

Truman draws his weapon and takes the lead. Hawk and Cooper
draw their weapons and follow. Hayward sits on a rock and
wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

CUT TO:

INT. SECOND CABIN - DAY

The door creaks open, throwing the only light into the dark
room. Truman, Hawk and Cooper cautiously enter. The music is
louder. Cooper draws aside a set of the heavy, dusty red
drapes, letting more light into the room.

On a simple record player, the tone arm pulled back over a
45 record, the song ends again, the stylus lifts, returns to
the outside, then back onto the outside edge of the record.
Scratches, pops, then the song starts again.

COOPER
(under his breath)
...and there's always music in the
air..."

Cooper lifts the stylus off the record. All three men proceed
with extreme care, trying not to move or disturb anything.

The single room is dusty, trashy, a low-rent version of a
harem room: an overstuffed davenport, cheap oriental throw
rugs, tasseled satin pillows, empty bottles and full ashtrays.

On a tripod, a 35 millimeter camera, facing a small photo
bay created by the drapes and pillows. Hawk checks it out.

HAWK
There's film in here.

Hawk takes out an evidence bag, removes the film.

Cooper finds a spool of twine lying on the floor

Another tripod shaped object, covered with a cloth. Truman
slowly draws the cloth off... a mynah bird in the cage reacts
drowsily, weak from hunger and thirst. A nameplate on the
cage reads... "O"

Hawk draws their attention to dark stains on the wood and
one of the throw rugs. He examines it.

HAWK
Blood.

Cooper moves to look at it.

Truman, backing up from the cage, hits a rocking chair which
rocks forward and hits a table, knocking over a lamp...

Hawk, looking past Cooper, sees the lamp...

HAWK
Watch out.

Cooper avoids the lamp as it crashes to the floor. Something
skitters off the lamp and rolls under the davenport Hawk and
Cooper look at each other. Cooper reaches in under the
davenport, feels around, finds something. He pulls it out

INTERCUT:

POKER CHIP

A thousand dollar chip, with a small chunk missing. It reads:
"ONE-EYED (J)ACK'S"

Cooper and Hawk look at each other.

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL BANQUET ROOM NIGHT

A banner reads:

"FROM ICELAND TO TWIN PEAKS: A GREAT NORTHERN WELCOME!!"

Festive, folksy Icelandic music, plays over the sound system.
The reception party is just under way. CITIZENS mingle with
the Icelanders, who cluster around the L-shaped buffet. The
Horne brothers mingle prominently. At the piano, Trudy leads
a group of Icelanders in an Icelandic version of Home on the
Range."

CUT TO:

INT. BANQUET ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Script above the door reads, "TIMBER ROOM." A HOTEL EMPLOYEE
is at the door, checking a guest list as people arrive. PETE
and CATHERINE MARTELL reach the door.

CATHERINE
Catherine Martell and spouse.

They're checked off the list and enter. We follow them.

PETE
Go easy on the sauce tonight, okay
Cathy?

She stops a passing WAITER with a tray of champagne. Takes
two glasses. Slugs one down.

CATHERINE
A few belts and even you might start
to look good to me.

She knocks back the second one, replaces the glasses on the
Waiter's tray, takes another glass and moves off, leaving
Pete.

CUT TO:

MAJOR BRIGGS AND EINER THORSON

The Officer chats up the head Icelander, while they graze
from the buffet.

MAJOR BRIGGS
--of course the modern age has changed
forever the way your people live,
Mr. Thorson, but my guess would be
that there still remains a tremendous
vestigial interest in the legends
and folklore of ancient Iceland.

EINER
(smiles, doesn't have
a clue)
Vestigial. Absolutely.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I know, speaking for myself, that I
find these last remnants of a
connection to a natural, more
primitive, almost pagan way of life,
endlessly fascinating; locally, for
instance, we have the Sasquatch
mythos, or Bigfoot, a large, evil
smelling forest-dweller, which I
suppose would correspond to your
"huldufolk" or hidden people.

EINER
Trolls?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Exactly.
(confidentially)
I also happen to be a firm believer
in the UFO. I've seen some high-level
classified data that would curl your
hair.

CUT TO:

JERRY HORNE

Jerry is all agog with the new object of his affection, the
tall and beautiful Icelandic girl, HEBA THORSDOTTIR, who's
playing with him.

JERRY
Heba. Take a bite of that salmon
tartare.
(he feeds her)
Did you know that was an American
figure of speech?

HEBA
No, Jerry.

JERRY
"Heba-heba."  You've never heard
that before?

HEBA
No, Jerry.

JERRY
Do you realize the incredible
potential that could result from our
taking a mutual dip into each other's
respective gene pools?
(she doesn't understand
the words, but she
gets his meaning;
they flirt)
Heba...
(almost a declaration
of love)
...I am going to cook for you.

CUT TO:

CATHERINE MARTELL

Snaring another drink, she spots Benjamin Home chatting up
some Icelanders two clusters away, makes her way to him. She
clears her throat, trying to get his attention. He chats on.
She does it again. No luck. She deliberately spills her drink
on his shoe.

CATHERINE
Oh.

BEN
Excuse me, gentlemen.

He takes her by the arm and steers her away. Quiet and angry.

BEN
My office, give me two minutes to
break away.

CATHERINE
(stops, looks at him;
a threat)
"Hell hath no fury..."

BEN
What?
(he sees her look)
Two minutes.

He moves off. She grabs another drink and heads for an exit.
She passes Audrey, who's semi-hiding behind a large wooden
column, watching the party with bright, disturbed eyes.
Moments later, she watches Ben leave by the same exit. She
follows him.

CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

JOSIE PACKARD enters the room, looks around, a little lonely
and out of place. She moves to Pete, who's piling up a massive
plate of food at the buffet.

JOSIE
Hello, Pete.

PETE
Hey, Josie, quite a spread they laid
out, grab yourself some grub.

JOSIE
(taking a plate,
looking around)
So these are the Icemen?

PETE
Somethin' like that.

CUT TO:

LELAND PALMER

At the entrance, Leland Palmer shuffles into the room. He's
pale, clean shaven but sporting a large piece of tissue paper
stuck to a shaving mishap on his jaw line. He looks shakily
around, wanting very badly to fit in.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Alone in the hallway, Audrey stops at a small secret door,
opens it.

INT. HOTEL WIRING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Audrey moves a short distance down the corridor in dim light,
kneels and slides a cover off a drilled peephole and looks
into...

INTERCUT:

AUDREY'S POV - INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE

Catherine pours a drink at the bar, Ben takes the decanter
of Scotch from her, pops the top in.

BEN
You're impossible.

CATHERINE
Tell me again, Ben, tell me what
you're going to do

BEN
Speak English.

CATHERINE
Tell me how you're going to drive
the mill into the ground, grind that
little Chinese flower to a fine dust,
regain control of my brother's land,
leave your wife and marry me.

Audrey reacts.

BEN
And they all lived happily ever after.

CATHERINE
(pleasantly)
Look into my eyes, Ben. Do I look
blind to you?

BEN
Excuse me?

CATHERINE
(still pleasant, takes
out the chip)
Why did you have this thousand dollar
poker chip from you know where in
your pants yesterday?

Ben looks at it, knows he's nailed. Straight-faced.

BEN
Jerry gave that to me.

She slaps him. He calmly pours himself a drink.

BEN
It's a good luck charm that I thought
I'd lost. I'm so relieved you've
found it.

She slaps him again. He sighs.

BEN
Are you quite finished?

She slaps him again. Satisfied, a bit hot.

CATHERINE
Yes.

She hands him the chip. He grabs her and kisses her hard.

Audrey is laughing so hard she has to cover her mouth and
turn away from the peephole.

breathless)
Not here.

CATHERINE
(whispers)
Let's burn the mill, let's do it,
tonight.

BEN
We'll just slip away from the party
and hope no one detects the smell of
kerosene upon return, no, my love,
we'll give Josie one last chance to
sell.

CATHERINE
You'll talk to her.

BEN
Tonight. Failing that, I've retained
the services of a qualified
professional.
(takes one, offers
one to her)
Breath mint?

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Audrey comes out the same small door, closes it behind her.
She staggers along the corridor, letting out her laughter,
big bursts, hysterical and gilded with an edge of desperation
and madness.

CUT TO:

INT. KING SALMON ROOM - NIGHT

Pete stands next to Einer Thorson, the head Icelander, both
holding plates of food.

PETE
Now let me get this straight; your
entire country is above the timber
line?

His mouth full of food, Einer nods.

JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
(amplified)
Folks, ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention please?

CUT TO:

JERRY HORNE

On a one-step riser at the end of the room, at a microphone.

JERRY
Can I have your attention please?

As the crowd congregates towards that side of the room.

JERRY
First off, I want to thank you all
for turning out tonight to welcome
our neighbors from the magical island
of Iceland. The Ghostwood Estates
project is an important part of our
future here in Twin Peaks, and there's
no group we'd rather have as a partner
in our future than--

He's drowned out by the blaring sound of big band music from
the speakers.

CUT TO:

LELAND PALMER

In the middle of the dance floor, he starts to go, a solitary
jitterbug. People clear out around him.

CUT TO:

BEN AND CATHERINE

Re-entering the room. Ben exchanges a look with Jerry, who's
panicking. Ben whispers to Catherine.

BEN
Dance with him.
(she gives him a look)
This is serious.

Catherine moves out towards Leland.

CUT TO:

LELAND AND CATHERINE

He slickly incorporates her into his dance and they commence
to cut a pretty mean rug. Leland is pouring down tears and
making little moaning sounds, but the crowd, happily clapping
along and half-soused, doesn't pick up those details.

INTERCUT:

BEN AND JERRY.

Ben makes his way to his brother.

BEN
Get Jacoby, get a net, get him out
of my life.

Jerry nods and moves off. Before he can get very far, he's
pulled out onto the floor by Heba and they begin to jitterbug.

CUT TO:

DANCE FLOOR - HIGH ANGLE

The Icelanders love this new dance craze and spill onto the
floor, doing their best to duplicate Leland's style...

CUT TO:

LELAND AND CATHERINE

Leland picks up his pace. Catherine realizes she's dancing
with a man teetering on the edge of a meltdown.

CUT TO:

AUDREY

Watching from behind a post, away from the dance floor. She's
crying.

CUT TO:

EXT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

Establish.

CUT TO:

INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Darkness. Madeleine creeps into the room, wearing a nightgown,
carrying a shoe box. A floorboard creaks. She gives a look
back upstairs, turns on a lamp, sits, picks up a phone and
quietly dials a number. Waits. Whispers.

MADELEINE
Donna? It's Maddy... I was looking
in Laura's closet and I couldn't
find anything but I looked up and
noticed there was a loose ceiling
panel?... yes, that was her hiding
place, I pushed the panel back, there
was a shoe box up there...

She takes off the cover of the box.

INTERCUT:

THE SHOE BOX

We see four audio cassette tape cases inside. On the top
case we can read: "To Dr. Jacoby." There's a noise from
upstairs that startles her.

MADELEINE
I'll meet you and James tomorrow.
Bring a tape recorder.

She hangs up, turns off the lamp, puts the cover back on the
shoe box and goes back out of the room.

CUT TO:

INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Darkness. Sounds of the party continue elsewhere. As our
eyes become accustomed to the darkness, we see someone sitting
at Ben's desk and the red glow of a cigarette as they inhale.

The door opens. Ben enters the room. Josie turns on the lamp
at the desk where she's seated. Ben crosses to the desk.

BEN
Did anyone see you come in here?

JOSIE
No.

BEN
You do realize the risk if anyone
sees us.

JOSIE
Yes.

He sits on the edge of the desk. Josie puts out her cigarette.

JOSIE
How much longer, Benjamin?

BEN
Tomorrow night.

They look at each other. She slowly extends her hand. He
takes her hand and kisses it tenderly. They look at each
other.

CUT TO:

EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

LEO JOHNSON pulls up in a beat-up pick-up truck with a covered
pay-load, stops beside a small shed outside his half-finished
garage. He gets out, looks around, unlocks the shack and
starts to load full gas-cans into the back of the truck.

INTERCUT:

INT. JOHNSON'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

A single, small lamp. Shelly, in robe and nightgown, moves
into the kitchen, looks out the window at Leo (off-screen).
Takes the gun from the table, puts it in her pocket, lights
a cigarette.

CUT TO:

LEO

Secures the tarp back over the gas cans and moves towards
the house when he's slugged from behind in the kidneys. He
grunts and goes down on one knee.

A SHADOWY ASSAILANT efficiently, silently and systematically
dismantles him, finally turning him and hitting him with
three hard right hands to the face. Dazed and bleeding, Leo
never knew what hit him. The Assailant grabs Leo by the lapels
and pulls him close. The Assailant is Hank Jennings.

HANK
You were supposed to mind the store
while I was gone, not open your own
franchise--

LEO
Hank--

A short punch, then...

HANK
Do as you're told, Leo. Next time
you'll watch me take your little
chippie apart before I kill you.

Hank lets him go and disappears.

INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Shelly, who hasn't heard a thing, finishes her cigarette.
Suddenly, Leo bursts in the door behind her, staggering to
the sink. turns on the water, his face a bloody mess...

LEO
Shelly, call a doctor--

SHELLY
Leo, what happened? You all right?

LEO
(lashing out)
Just call the damn doctor, do as
you're told!

He backhands her, sends her sprawling. She lands hard. Takes
the gun from her pocket.

LEO
What are you sitting around for? I
said--
(sees the gun)
What the hell are you doin' with
that?

SHELLY
(taking out the gun)
Don't touch me, Leo, don't come near
me--

LEO
(laughing)
What are you gonna do, Shelly, shoot
me?

SHELLY
You're not gonna hurt me again--

LEO
(bile seeping above
the pain)
You stupid little slut, you don't
even know how to use one--
(he advances on her)
Besides, you haven't got the guts--

Shelly closes her eyes and fires. Leo yells, falls back,
knocking the lamp off the table. Darkness. Screaming. The
front door slams open and shut, the screaming moves outside.

Shelly huddles in a corner, clutching the gun, terrified. We
hear the pick-up truck start and drive off. Shelly tries to
catch her breath.

CUT TO:

INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dale Cooper rounds the corner, takes out his room key. He
stops, listens to the sounds of the still raucous Icelandic
party going on downstairs. Cooper sadly shakes his head,
starts to unlock his door and realizes it's open. He draws
his gun.

CUT TO:

INT. COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The door stands open, light coming in from the corridor.
Cooper enters a moment later, with his weapon drawn. He slowly
closes the door, moves in, keeping the gun trained on the
bed.

COOPER
Reach over slowly and turn on the
bedside lamp.

There's someone in the bed. The person turns on the lamp.
Audrey. Naked under the sheets, eyes red with tears.

AUDREY
Don't make me leave. Please don't
make me leave.

Cooper slowly lowers his weapon.

CUT TO:



INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Looking through the open door into Cooper's room. COOPER lies still on the floor, flat on
his back at the foot of the bed.
Looking down the corridor, here comes a ROOM SERVICE WAITER, carrying a glass of
warm milk on a tray. He stops at the open doorway, sees Cooper, knocks.
WAITER
Room service.
No response. He enters cautiously.
Cooper's eyes open. He looks up as the Waiter, who is no scholar.
WAITER 
(grins)
How you doin' down there?
Cooper blinks a few times, dazed and disoriented. Pause.
WAITER 
Warm milk.
He proudly holds up the glass.
COOPER
(finding his voice)
Could you ... put it on the table?
WAITER
Sure.
The Waiter gingerly steps around him and sets the glass of milk down on the table beside the
phone receiver, from where he hears ...
ANDY'S VOICE
Hello? ... Agent Cooper? ... Agent Cooper?
The Waiter looks down at Cooper, then decides to helpfully hang up the receiver.






WAITER
Hung it up for you.
COOPER
What's that?
WAITER
Hung it up. The phone.
COOPER
Oh.
(pause)
Thank you.
WAITER
No problem.
The Waiter stands in front of him, holding the bill, takes out a pen. Cooper's attention drifts
off him, drifts back.
COOPER
Yes?
The Waiter holds out the bill and pen. Cooper takes them, holds them above his chest, trying
to focus
COOPER 
Does this include a gratuity?
WAITER
Yes sir.
Cooper scrawls a signature. The Waiter takes back the bill and pen.
WAITER 
That milk'll cool down on ya'.
The Waiter smiles, backs up to the door, stops, grins, points a finger. He's figured it out.
WAITER
I heard about you.
Cooper looks at him. The Waiter grins again, gives a small wave and a wink and moves off.
We hear his footsteps move do, the coorridor. They stop. Slower footsteps come back.
The Waiter peeks around the corner, looks at Cooper again, grins, shakes his head and
moves off. The footsteps recede.


(2)
Cooper takes a cautious deep breath. He closes his eyes, wincing in pain. He turns his head
towards the bed, opens his eyes and slowly realizes that, looming above him, a GIANT is
sitting on the foot of the bed looking down at him.
The Giant appears to be at least eight feet tall. He's wearing dark pants, a white shirt rolled
up at the sleeves and a slender black tie.
GIANT
I will tell you three things.
(pause)
If I tell them to you, and they come true, then will you
believe me?
COOPER
Who are you?
GIANT
Think of me as a friend.
COOPER
Where did you come from?
GIANT
(shakes his head)
The question is: where have you gone?
Cooper blinks, ponders.
GIANT 
The first thing I will tell you is: "The man in the
smiling bag."
COOPER
(mumbles to himself, trying, to remember)
"Smiling bag."
GIANT
The second thing is: "The owls are not what you think."
Cooper repeats the words, clinging to them.
GIANT
The third thing is: "He points without the proper chemical."
Cooper repeats the phrase to himself.








(3)
COOPER
What, what does this mean?
GIANT
This is all I am permitted to say. If you find these
things to be true, I will visit you again. We want to help
you.
COOPER
Who's "we?"
GIANT
One last thing: Leo locked inside a hungry horse. By the
way, you will require medical attention.
Cooper looks down at his shirt. A bloodstain is slowly spreading across his midsection. He
looks back. The Giant is gone. Cooper doesn't move.
COOPER
Holy jumpin' George.

EXT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Establish. Off the One-Eyed sign ...
CUT TO:



INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM NIGHT
CLOSE on AUDREY'S eye, peering out from between the curtains, draped around the
fourposter in her room. Audrey stands on the bed. There are two masks on the wall above
the headboard.
BEN HORNE enters the room, sees movement behind the curtains.
BEN
Knock, knock.
(pause)
Knock. Knock.
AUDREY
(changing her voice)
Who's there?
BEN
The big bad wolf.






AUDREY
Go away.
BEN
Interesting.
(takes a moment)
Come on, let's have a look at you.
AUDREY
I'm shy.
BEN
Didn't you know? Everybody's shy. Here at One-Eyed
Jack's it's a transitory condition. And an occupational
handicap.
He tries to pry the curtain apart for a look, she snaps it shut. He takes out a cigar; having
been through this before, he falls back on technique.
BEN 
But, consider; your first night in a new place, new
surroundings, new people AUDREY
New wardrobe BEN
(warming to the task)
- naturally you are full of questions, anxieties. You're
wondering "What's expected of me? how will I be
received? will they ... like me?" I'm right, aren't I?
AUDREY
Yes.
Ben patrols the perimeter, toying with the curtains, as she moves with him, defending her
translucent barrier, trying to anticipate his angle of attack.
BEN
Let's examine these feelings, shall we? What are they if
not the natural emotional processes of any living,
breathing person who finds herself thrust ... into new
circumstances?
AUDREY
(pause)
Could you repeat the question?





(2)
BEN
You're nervous, you're shy, you're frightened: of course
you are...
(another thought)
How exactly new to all this are you?
AUDREY
You might say ... brand new.
BEN
(the thought cheers him)
Really.
AUDREY
For instance, if I was a bar of soap, I'd still be wrapped
in my package.
BEN
(enthusiasm swells)
Alright' fine, now I have to see you ...
He puts his cigar in his mouth, tries to open the curtain again; she thwarts him. He thrusts a
hand inside. She slaps it away.
BEN 
(happy)
A vixen! What's your name?
AUDREY
Queen of Diamonds.
BEN
No, no, no, your real name.
AUDREY
I'm not supposed to tell.
BEN
Did they tell you who I was?
AUDREY
The owner?
BEN
That's right. Tell me your name.
AUDREY
You wouldn't believe me.





(3)
BEN
I'm a liberal thinker.
AUDREY
Prudence.
BEN
Prudence!
AUDREY
I think you should go.
BEN
Do you, Prudence?
AUDREY
Yes I do. I really do.
BEN
(pause)
All right.
She listens cautiously. Ben walks to the door, opens and closes it, tiptoes back into the room,
towards the bed. He triumphantly throws the curtains open.
BEN 
'Got you!
She's hiding under the covers, a conspicuous lump. Ben advances.
BEN 
I'll huff ... and I'll puff ... and I'll blow your house
down!
He yanks the covers away. She's revealed: a mask covers her features.
BEN 
Aren't you ... something?
He advances further. She retreats. He reaches for her, she slaps his hands away, grabs a
pillow and whacks him across the head. He laughs. She's backed against the wall. He reaches
for her mask.
BEN 
Please ... I have to ... see you ...
His hand reaches the mask. An urgent knock at the door. Ben hesitates. Another knock.

JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
Ben, it's Jer! Brother Ben, we've got a situation!
BEN
So have I.
JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
Ben, it's the M-I-L-L! And we got a big S-N-A-G!
Ring a bell?
BEN
(to Audrey)
Alas, I do have a situation.
AUDREY
Gee, that's too bad.
BEN
(all business, rising, putting on coat)
I like you. You know how to interest a man. That's half
the battle. You've got quite a future in front of you.
AUDREY
That's what everyone keeps telling me.
JERRY'S VOICE
Ben, I'm gonna count to three BEN
Coming, Jer!
(straightens his tie, checks the mirror)
Prudence, I'm leaving now, but I'm going to get myself
back up here to see you right away. And next time we'll
play a different game. I'll make the rules. A fun game.
You'll like it. Everybody wins.
He drops some money the table, blows her a kiss and blows out of the room.
Audrey lowers the mask. She's laughing silently, tears running down her face, close to the
edge.
CUT TO:



INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Ben and Jerry enter Blackie's office. BLACKIE sits behind her desk, looking worn and
haggard. She has the shakes.






BEN
How many blips are we dealing with?
JERRY
Two blips: blip number one, they contained the fire in
the drying sheds BEN
It didn't spread to the processing plant?
JERRY
Just the plywood building, not the main plant.
BEN
Manageable. What's blip number two?
JERRY
Leo the Lip's in the hospital BEN
As in morgue?
JERRY
That's a big N-O.
Ben chews on that. Turns to Blackie.
BEN
Keep an eye on that new girl. She didn't come across.
JERRY
This sounds like a job for Jerry Horne Taking off his coat, Jerry starts for the door. Ben grabs him by the collar.
BEN
Blackie, you're looking a little the worse for wear ...
She shoots him a poisonous look. He takes a packet from his pocket.
BEN 
Would you like to fix yourself a cocktail? Or would
you rather just say "no?"
BLACKIE
Bastard.





(2)
BEN
What's that, Blackie?
BLACKIE
(humbling herself)
Please.
BEN
And you used to be so pretty.
Ben signals to Jerry, who exits. Ben moves to the door.
BLACKIE
PLEASE.
(he stops, looks at her, she's trembling)
Pretty ... please
Ben tosses the packet onto the desk, shakes his head and exits. Blackie looks at the packet,
opens a drawer [plus other drug paraphenalia], takes out a length of rubber tubing and sets
it on the desk.

Pete takes Truman's hand, partially lifts off his mask.
PETE

TRUMAN
Not yet, Pete.






They look at each other. Pete coughs, they readjust his mask, slide the gurney in, close the
doors. The siren starts up, the ambulance drives off.
Truman moves away and is joined by DEPUTY HAWK

somebody was banging real loud on the door TRUMAN

Hawk and Truman look at each other.

INT. COOPER'S ROOM - DAWN
Cooper's hand reaches out for his tape recorder on the floor not far from where he's lying.
His fingertips reach it, gain purchase and drag it back to him. In pain and slightly fumblefingered he's able to activate the record button, lie back and bring the recorder to his mouth.
COOPER
Diane, it's - I don't know what time it is, Diane, I've
been shot. I was out for a while and I can't reach my







COOPER 
watch. The sky's getting light, I can hear birdsong. I'm
lying on the floor of my room. There is a great deal of
pain and a fair amount of blood. I seem to remember
three shots, all to the midsection. I was wearing my vest
last night, per Bureau regulations when undercover, but
even so, if you can imagine someone dropping three
bowling balls on your chest from a height of about nine
feet you might begin to approximate the sensation.
(looking at his chest)
On balance, though, being shot is not as bad as I had
always imagined it might be. If you can manage to
keep the fear from your mind. Then again, I suppose
you could say that about almost anything in life: it's not
so bad if you can keep the fear from your mind.
(he wrestles with it)
At a time like this, curiously, you immediately think of
the things you regret, or the things you would miss. I
would like, in general, to treat people with much more
care and respect. I would like to climb a tall hill, sit in
the cool grass and feel the sun on my face. I wish I could
have cracked the Lindbergh kidnapping. I would very
much like to make love to a beautiful woman who I had
genuine affection for. I would like that very much.
(he has to stop)
All in all, a very interesting experience.
SOUND of running footsteps. Truman, Hawk and Andy appear in the doorway.

Johnson, Leo ...
A NURSE takes a seventh unmarked chart; off the last hook and CAMERA MOVES with her
picking up staying with an extremely tired DOC HAYWARD sitting in a chair. She hands
the chart to Hayward. He rises and together they move into an adjoining room ...
CUT TO:
 INT. INTENSIVE CARE DAY
Hayward and the Nurse enter. Cooper is seated on an examining table. Another NURSE is
cutting away his shirt; revealing his bulletproof vest. Truman stands nearby.
COOPER
(pale, shaky but game)
Morning, Doc.
HAYWARD
My God, what happened to you?
COOPER
Three slugs, point blank range.
TRUMAN
You can't remember anything about the shooter.
COOPER
All I saw was that muzzle flash and the next thing I knew
I was drifting on Cloud Nine - busy night, Doc?
HAYWARD
Haven't seen this much action since the Elks Club fire in
'59 - here we go ...
Doc and the Nurse ease the bloodstained vest off Cooper. He groans. Large ugly bruises are




 
revealed. LUCY enters with a clipboard, thermos of coffee and some mugs, just in time to see
the bruises.
LUCY
(a little faint)
Oh boy ...
A little woozy, Truman helps her to a chair.
TRUMAN
Easy there, Luce.
LUCY
Oh boy ...
One of the Nurses partially closes the curtain between the bed and where Lucy is sitting. Lucy
pours herself a cup of coffee.
COOPER
Looks worse than it feels Lucy.
HAYWARD
Let's have you lie back.
Hayward and a Nurse help Cooper lie back. We see there's a bullet partially embedded in his
midsection near a rib.
COOPER
Doc, I think I picked up a wood tick last night. While
trying to scratch it off I adjusted my vest upwards and I
think one shot glanced off the edge of my vest.
HAYWARD
(examining the bullet)
Agent Cooper, I'd have to say you're lucky to be alive.
COOPER
I try to tell myself that at least once a day.
LUCY
Coffee?
COOPER
You bet.
TRUMAN
(taking a cup, quietly)
Lucy, Agent Cooper needs to be brought up to date.

LUCY
Okay.
TRUMAN
Cooper, I'm working on a warrant for Leo. Arrest and search
Truman exits. Hayward is prepping to remove the bullet from Cooper's side.
COOPER
Go ahead, Lucy.
LUCY
Okay.
HAYWARD
I ought to administer an anesthetic.
COOPER
No, just hand me my wallet and say when.
Puzzled, Doc nods to a Nurse, who hands Cooper his wallet.
LUCY
This morning, at around 5:45 a.m. Jacques Renault was
found dead in his bed. It appears to be cardiac arrest,
which is what happened to my Uncle Walter after he had
the accident with the lawnmower, but the cause of death
is not yet officially known.
COOPER
Autopsy?
HAYWARD
Soon as we get a minute.
COOPER
Please continue, Lucy.
Cooper watches as Hayward lays out a row of severe looking surgical instruments,
including a wicked pliar-like utensil.
LUCY
Doctor Jacoby is resting comfortably after his heart
attack, and Ronnette Pulaski is still on life support,
which the Sheriff told me you already knew about but
that I should remind you.

COOPER
Thank you.
HAYWARD
You might be able to question Jacoby later today.

Shelly Johnson and Pete Martell are in stable condition

Smoke inhalation, in addition to which I think Shelly is
a smoker anyway.
Doc and Cooper look at each other.
LUCY 
Nadine Hurley is still unconscious and in serious
condition because of an overdose of sleeping pills.
COOPER
Accidental?
HAYWARD

Ed says she left a note.
COOPER
Damn.
HAYWARD
Ready, Cooper?
COOPER

Keep talking, Lucy.
Cooper puts the wallet in his mouth and bites down hard. Hayward picks up the pliars and
goes to work.
LUCY
Leo Johnson was found in his house by Deputy Brennan

LUCY 
with a single gunshot wound to his upper chest. There
appears to be a spinal injury associated with this wound,
he's just out of surgery an at this time is still
unconscious and in critical condition Hayward, who's been working vigorously, pulls hard, the bullet comes out and Cooper lets
out a yell. Hayward examines the bullet. We see the leg's of a dead tick attached to the end.
HAYWARD
Hell of a way to kill a tick.

Truman enters another room, where a NURSE is tending to Shelly, lying quietly in bed, pale,
exhausted, coughing gently every now and then. Truman nods to the Nurse, who exits.
Truman sits by the edge of the bed. Shelly manages a weak smile.
TRUMAN
Hi Shelly.
SHELLY
Hi. Hope you don't mind if I don't get you coffee.
(starts to cough. He pats her arm)
Leo know I'm here?
TRUMAN

What? What?
TRUMAN
Leo was shot last night. He's here in the hospital.
SHELLY
Oh my God ...
TRUMAN
It's bad. You should know there's a chance he may not
make it.



 
SHELLY
Oh my God, what happened?
TRUMAN
We don't know. We found him at your house about an
hour ago.
SHELLY
At our house?
Truman nods. Shelly's thinking, eyes darting around, exploring the possibilities.
TRUMAN
Shelly ... we're gonna need to ask you some questions.
(she nods)
Can you tell me what you were doing at the mill?
Tears come to Shelly's eyes.
SHELLY
Would it be okay if maybe ... we could talk a little
later? It's just ... you know, with Leo ...
She starts to cry. Truman pats her on the shoulder.
TRUMAN
I understand. You rest up for a while. I'll be back to see
you.

Thanks, Sheriff.
Truman rises, exits. Shelly tries to put the pieces together.

She's always been a fighter. I'm betting on her.
TRUMAN
I'd lay money on that myself.

to get hold of him.
Truman decides not to complicate Ed's emotional state.
TRUMAN
Let me take care of that for you.
ED
Thanks, Harry.
(emotion swelling again)
She knows I'm there. She squeezes my hand when I talk
to her. She can hear me.
TRUMAN
'Course she can, Ed. You stay with her. You'll bring her
back.
Ed pats him on the back, nods, goes back in, as Truman moves off.
Cooper, walking stiffly, putting on his shirt, is exiting his room further down the corridor,
pursued by a distraught Hayward and a confused Lucy.
HAYWARD
- I want to be very clear this is completely against my
recommendation COOPER
Thanks, Doc, duly noted HAYWARD
You've lost some blood, you've got two cracked ribs,
some torn cartiledge and possibly a bruised lung 




(2)
COOPER
(overlapping)
Lucy, maybe you could run down to the pharmacy and
pick me up a large bottle of aspirin - Doc, when the
will is firmly invoked the recuperative powers of the
physical body are simply extraordinary HAYWARD
Harry, I want to go on record, this man should be in a
hospital.
TRUMAN
I hear you, Doc (to Cooper, search warrant in hand)
We're ready to give Leo's house a top to bottom.
COOPER
Good, let's get to work.
TRUMAN
I guess we can't formally arrest him until he's conscious.
COOPER
Correct. Put a guard on his door, zip up the exits,
nothing leaks to the press until we've finished the search.
Cooper stops. Ahead of them, being wheeled out of a room and down the hall by two
[ORDERLIES] is a gurney holding a huge figure in a large rubber body bag.
COOPER
What's that?
TRUMAN
That's Jacques.
COOPER
(remembering)
"Shock in a big rubber bag."
TRUMAN
Excuse me?
COOPER
Tell you later. Come on, Harry, we've got work to do:
the attempted murder of a federal agent is an extremely
serious crime and it barely cracks our top five.
Cooper moves off, a pained, awakward gait. Hayward and Truman look at each other.




 (3)
Truman shrugs and starts after Cooper.
COOPER 
Harry, if you don't mind, you're going to have to do
most of the driving.
As they round the corner, we move to look down a long, empty corridor. We move down it
slowly.
DISSOLVE TO:
15A. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
We move in on RONETTE PULASKI, lying in bed, hooked up to life support. As we get
closer, she moves in a way that indicates she's coming out of the coma.

Establish.
CUT TO:
 INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - DAY
SARAH PALMER and MADDY FERGUSON are having coffee both lost in private
thought. Pause.
MADDY
I had the strangest dream last night.
SARAH
About Laura?
MADDY
I'm not sure. Maybe. I was in a desert. It was hot and
dry. There was some kind of animal with me, I
couldn't see it but I could feel it breathing on me.
SARAH
What kind of animal?
MADDY
A big cat. I think it was gray. I could see its eyes,
yellow and red. Then we were in the woods. It was very
dark. I woke up and the window was open. There was a
cold wind blowing through the room.
From the other room, loud robust singing approaches.



 
LELAND'S VOICE
"Oh, marsey-doats and dosesy-doats and little lambs
eat ivy/A kiddlede ivy too, wouldn't you? ... marseydoats and dosesy-doats and little lambs eat ivy/A
kiddledeet ivy too, wouldn't you? ... "
LELAND PALMER enters the room, well dressed in a three-piece buisness suit, carrying his
briefcase. He continues to sing, happy and good-natured, genuinely trying to entertain the
two women. His hair has turned completely white.
LELAND 
"Now if the words sound queer and funny to your ear/
A little bit jumpled and jivey ...
(moving closer to them)
Say 'Mares eat oats and does eat oats, and little lambs
eat ivy' ...
He kisses them both, grabs his hat, kind of flips it onto his head, picks up an umbrella and
exits, still singing ...
LELAND 
"Oh, marsey-doats; and dosesy-doats; and little lambs
eat ivy/A kiddledeet ivy too, wouldn't you? ... marseydoats and dosesy-doats and little lambs eat ivy/A

CUT TO:
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
On a television set in the corner, featuring a news story about the burning mill. SOUND of
half-spirited Icelander singing from the hall outside. Ben and Jerry appear in the hallway, turn
and speak back to the Icelanders in the hall.
BEN
Travel safely, Einer; (Icelandic phrase): next year in
Rekyavik!
Ben pulls Jerry into the office, closes the door and barks instructions.
BEN 
On the bus, on the runway, right up to the plane; no
television, no newspapers and make sure the pilot
doesn't fly over the mill, until their check clears as far as
they're concerned that fire never happened.
JERRY
What fire?
Ben gives him a friendly slap on the cheek.
BEN
(lowers his voice)
Agenda: let's get a location on Catherine, keep our
distance, We just want to be sure she's ready to take the
fall, I want a complete medical on Leo Johnson's
prospects for recovery and a satisfying explanation from
Hank Jennings why that punk [LEO] isn't being measured for a
plot at Ghostwood Memorial Park.
JERRY
Well begun is half done.
The SOUND of the Icelanders is interrupted by the approaching sound of Leland singing
"Mare-se-doats." The doors open as he finishes the chorus. Leland spreads his
arms, a happy smile on his face, his white hair standing up like a field of albino wheat.
LELAND
I'm back!



 
Ben and Jerry stare at him for a long time.
CUT TO:
 EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
A lot of police vehicles parked outside.
CUT TO:
 INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
Full-scale forensics going on in the living room; technicians measuring the trajectory the
bullet took through the broken window. Truman examines the bite Leo's axe took out of the
wall. Hawk comes out of the bedroom with a small box containing some skin mags,
including a few back issues of Flesh World, takes them to Cooper, seated stiffly on a chair in
the middle of the room. We see two PLAINCLOTHES COPS are carefully dismantling the
kitchen in a thorough search.
HAWK
Surprise; Flesh World.
COOPER
Good customers must get complimentary subscriptions.
HAWK
Still no cocaine, here or in the truck.
COOPER
We may have to bring in the dogs. Let's get those down
to the station.
TRUMAN
I can't figure it; some kind of fight was going on in here.
COOPER
Well they weren't doing the Tennessee waltz.
TRUMAN
But the shot came from outside.
COOPER
He wasn't shot by the person he was fighting with.
TRUMAN
(an idea taking shape)
Two people.



 
COOPER
Leo was trying to turn somebody to kindling. The
person went down and hit that television; the legs were
moved off the depressions in the carpet. Leo advanced,
axe raised, the shot knocked him back onto the couch.
TRUMAN
Shelly?
COOPER
Shelly's about ninety-nine pounds soaking wet; that's a
big old television.
TRUMAN
Was she the shooter?
COOPER
That depends on when she got to the mill.
Truman nods.
CUT TO:
 EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S - DAY
Deputy Andy is working the perimeter outside. He looks up to see a government issue car
roar up nearby and stop in a cloud of dust. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and his two
ASISSTANTS climb out of the car. Andy immediately turns and runs to the house.
CUT TO:
 INT. LEO JOHNSON'S PORCH - DAY
Andy enters and starts for the door.
ANDY
Harry! Harry! It's Agent Rosenflower!
Andy steps on a loose plank levers up like a shot and WHACKS him in the face. He goes
down. Truman comes out onto the porch from the kitchen, just as Albert enters through the
outside door. They stare at each other. Andy moans quietly. Albert looks at him.
ALBERT
Another great moment in law enforcement history.
The plank Andy dislodged reveals a cavity under the porch, which Truman is the first to
notice. He kneels down to take a look ...
CUT TO:



 INSERT - THE PORCH CAVITY
Secreted inside is Leo's stash, prominently featuring a couple of kilo bricks of cocaine.
CUT TO:
TRUMAN

TRUMAN
Albert, I guess you were more right than you know.
Good work, Andy.
His nose bleeding, Andy manages a cockeyed grin.

 EXT. DINER - DAY
Establish.
CUT TO:
 INT. DINER KITCHEN - DAY
A small bottle of ammonia or some like chemical is opened. HANK JENNINGS lets the
fumes from the bottle drift up into his face. He inhales, his eyes redden and start to rear. He
replaces the bottle top and hides the bottle as NORMA JENNINGS enters the kitchen.
She's not in uniform this morning.
Hank lets her catch a glimpse of him before turning away.
NORMA
Hank?
Hank grabs a broom and starts to sweep up, trying to hide his "tears."
HANK
Yeah. Hi.
NORMA
What is it?
HANK
Nuthin'. Fine.
She regards him, trust still an issue but today perhaps slightly more on the fence.



 
NORMA
(waiting him out)
Uh-huh.
HANK
(pause, stops sweeping)
I can't stop thinking of little Shelly in that burning mill
... and then as if that's not bad enough, she comes out of
it to find Leo's been shot? I don't know. I mean I've
done some rotten things in my life, I don't pretend to be
any saint, I've paid for it, but why do bad things happen
to good people? It just ... doesn't seem fair.
(tries to lighten up)
Anyway ...
NORMA
(somewhat noncommital)
I'm just on my way over to see her.
HANK
Yeah, listen, I was gonna send her some flowers
(takes out some cash)
Maybe you could ...
She takes the money.
NORMA
That's a nice thought.
HANK
Sometimes I guess it is the thought that counts.
NORMA
She'll get through this. She's tougher than she looks.
HANK
Yeah. Kind'a reminds me of somebody.
A wistful grin for her benefit. She half-smiles, pockets the money, starts out.
NORMA
She likes snapdragons.
CUT TO:
 INT. DINER - DAY
Norma busies herself behind the counter for a moment. Behind her DONNA HAYWARD




 
enters the diner, wearing sunglasses, spots Maddy Ferguson sitting at the counter, moves to
her and together they move to a booth, maintaining a conspiritorial tone.
MADDY
Is it true about James?
DONNA
He spent the night in jail.
MADDY
Do you think it's because of what we did?
DONNA
Look, we don't know if we "did" anything. My dad
says Dr. Jacoby got sick because he was attacked; all we
did was send him a tape.
MADDY
Maybe he wouldn't have been attacked if we hadn't.
DONNA
Maybe. Maybe the sun won't come up tomorrow if we
wash our hair. Think like that you could go crazy.
What's done is done. The only way this won't came
back to haunt us is if we keep quiet about what happened
last night, because I can promise you that's what James is
doing. Get the picture?
MADDY
(feeling a little distant)
Loud and clear.
DONNA
I don't know why they're holding James, I'll try to find
out. In the meantime, mum is the word.
MADDY
I heard they caught Laura's killer.
DONNA
If that's true why haven't they made an announcement?
MADDY
That's what Uncle Leland said this morning DONNA
Did they come to your house? Did you see it on the
news?



 (2)
MADDY
No DONNA
Then until that happens we still have work to do.
MADDY
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.
DONNA
Really?
MADDY
White as a sheet.
DONNA
That's weird.
Norma sees them.
NORMA
Oh, Donna,. I've got something for you here.
She takes an envelope out from under the counter and moves to the booth.
NORMA 
This came in the mail for you yesterday.
DONNA
Thanks, Norma.
She looks at it.
INTERCUT:
 THE ENVELOPE
Adddressed to "Donna Hayward, c/o Norma Jennings, Double R Diner"
DONNA 
That's odd.
DONNA
As Donna examines it, Norma nods, moves off, exits the diner.
MADDY
What is it?



 
Donna shrugs, opens the envelope, finds a note inside, printed in block letters.
INTERCUT:
 THE NOTE
It reads: LOOK INTO THE MEALS ON WHEELS.

 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - DAY
Audrey, alone in her room, sprawled on the bed playing solitaire. She hums. She cheats.
A knock at the door. A FIFTY-TWO PICK-UP GIRL enters.
AUDREY
Say, when do they put on the feedbag around here? I
could eat a bear.
PICK-UP
Kitchen's open twenty-four hours a day.
AUDREY
Yeah? My door isn't. There's no doorknob on my side.
PICK-UP
That's for security.
AUDREY
Whose security?
PICK-UP
All the new girls get this room at first.
AUDREY
(this is interesting)
All of them?
PICK-UP
Until they trust you.
AUDREY
Then what happens?
The Girl likes her and is friendly, but is also clearly operating under some other instructions.



 
PICK-UP
Keep asking so many questions and you'll never find out.
AUDREY
They don't like you asking questions?
The Girl gestures to be quiet, nods, points to a small screen in the wall; a speaker. Audrey
nods, understanding.
AUDREY 
(for the speaker's benefit)
I wouldn't normally be so curious, but Jack's is such a
first-rate joint I'd like to know more about how it's run.
PICK-UP
(playing along)
This may be your chance to find out; Blackie would like
to see you in her office.
AUDREY
(still playing to the speaker)
Hey, great.
They move towards the door.
AUDREY 
(whispers)
What's your name?
PICK-UP
(whispers)
Nancy.
AUDREY
(still whispering)
Nancy, one more question ...
(pulls on her own bustier)
... don't your boobs start to hurt in this thing?
Nancy covers her mouth to hide her laugh and nods.
CUT TO:
 INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE, - DAY
Audrey enters. Blackie, fixed up, looking cool and steely, is getting a shoulder rub from one
of the PICK-UPs. Another PICK-UP is kneeling in front of her, rubbing her feet.



 
AUDREY
Hey, boss, what's up?
BLACKIE
(let's that pass)
The owner was a little disappointed in your performance
last night.
AUDREY
Oh? That's not what he told me.
BLACKIE
He said you were witholding.
AUDREY
Okay, right away, here's my analysis of the guy, he's a
big cheese, girls are falling like ripe tomatoes every
time he walks into a room. Hey, a steady diet of caviar
would eventually kill you, right? I ask myself, what's
this guy missing? Conquest, the thrill of victory.
BLACKIE
So you turned tail and made him chase you.
AUDREY
So to speak. You know the guy, am I right?
BLACKIE
(cooly assesses her, then)
Did you find him attractive?
AUDREY
Attractive? Yes. I wouldn't say he was my type exactly.
Blackie rises and insinuates her way right up to Audrey. She touches Audrey's check.
BLACKIE
And who would you say is your type, exactly?
AUDREY
Not you. No offense.
Blackie slaps her hard. Audrey raises her hand to slap back. Blackie catches her wrist.
BLACKIE
Let's get one thing straight between us, princess ...



 (2)
AUDREY
(not flinching)
Okay.
Audrey hears the snick of a lock engaging. [She looks down.] Blackie's put a handcuff on her
wrist.
BLACKIE 
When you work for me, everybody's your type. Whether
you like it or not.
They look at each other.

 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Cooper, shirt off, ribs heavily taped, sits on the conference table, as Albert Rosenfield
examines him, using a stethescope. Albert's briefcase is open on the table.
ALBERT
How simple can I make it, Cooper? FBI Agent gets
shot; FBI Agent investigates. I'm in proximity,
working in the Seattle lab, I'm familiar with the
underlying case COOPER
We don't know that they're related.
ALBERT
Right. You didn't pick up your towels so the chamber
maid plugged you.
COOPER
Albert, the point is you're not going to win any local
popularity contests ALBERT
No, the point is Gordon Cole ordered me back here.
We follow orders. Breathe.
(he listens to a breath)
You were shot by a right-handed person, five foot six to
ten inches tall, at a distance of less than three feet. I'll
have ballistics this afternoon. You're blank on other
details?
COOPER
Yes.
ALBERT
I'll take it from here. Meanwhile one of your principal
suspects was murdered in his hospital bed, the other was
shot in his living room. You tell me: vigilante justice or
just clean country living?



 
COOPER
Albert, let me ask you something; where does this
attitude of generalized unpleasantness come from?
ALBERT
(pause, looks at him)
I'll get back to you.
COOPER
If you don't want both eyes blackened on a regular basis,
while you're here I suggest you make some kind of peace
with rural life.
ALBERT
Great. After the square dance maybe we can go for a
hayride. I'll be at the hospital.
A knock. Andy Brennan enters.
ANDY
Agent Cooper? You wanted to see me?
COOPER
Have a seat, Andy.
Andy sits. Albert packs up his briefcase.
COOPER 
Andy, I wanted to have a brief chat about the events of
yesterday.
ANDY
Okay.
COOPER
When an officer's involved in something like this, it can
result in a great number of distractions in the workplace.
ANDY
Uh-huh.
COOPER
The thing to focus on is your daily routine; cling to it.
Let it become the tent pole around which you organize
your waking life.



 (2)
ANDY
(hanging on every word)
Okay.
COOPER
The job can provide the structure you need to survive,
while body and mind are left free to heal the wounds our
work occasionally, inevitably inflicts.
ANDY
(starting to look confused)
All right.
COOPER
Even if committed in the line of duty and in a timely
and heroic fashion, the firing of our weapon, the shooting
of another human being, no matter how villainous the
individual may be, exacts a spiritual and emotional toll
on the officer.
ANDY
(sees the light)
Oh.
(clearing up the misunderstanding)
I thought you were talking about me and Lucy.
Cooper looks at him. At the door, Albert looks at Andy, back at Cooper.
ALBERT
Where do they keep his water dish?
Albert exits.
CUT TO:
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION - DAY
Albert exits past Lucy, at the coffee station.
LUCY
Welcome back.
ALBERT
(takes her coffee cup)
For me? You shouldn't have.
Albert exits the station, passing PHILLIP MICHAEL GIRARD, the one-armed man, just
entering, muscling in his hefty sample case. He approaches Lucy, back at her desk. [Behind]
[him comes TOM, the mailman, a small, chatty fellow, carrying the day's load, including]
[a fair]



 
[sized box.]
GIRARD
Excuse me, is Sheriff Truman here?
LUCY
He is but he's busy at the moment, may I help you?
[Tom holds up the mail, shows Lucy the box.]
[TOM]
[Got a box here, Luce.]
[LUCY]
[Thanks, Tom, just set it down there on the floor in front]
[of the desk next to this gentleman.]
[TOM]
[Pretty good-sized box.]
GIRARD
I'm afraid I don't have an appointment.
[TOM]
[(a snoop)]
[Addressed to that Agent Cooper, care of the Sheriff.]
[What do you suppose this could be?]
[LUCY]
[I'm sure I don't know.]
GIRARD
The Sheriff asked me to stop by at my convenience, this
was the first convenient moment.
[TOM]
[Return address Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.]
[LUCY]
[(trying to get rid of him)]
[Thanks, Tom. Put the box down now.]
[TOM]
[I don't think it's fragile, least ways it's not marked]
[fragile.]
[LUCE]
[See you tomorrow, Tom.]

[TOM]
[You bet'cha.]

Will the Sheriff know what this is regarding?
GIRARD

I'm here to sell him some shoes.
CUT TO:
 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
JAMES HURLEY sits across from Sheriff Truman. A small tape recorder sits on the table
between them. We hear ...
LAURA'S VOICE
(from the tape)
... uh-oh, here comes Mom with milk and cookies ... see
you later, Lawrence, bye-bye.
Tape hiss, then silence. Truman turns off the tape.
TRUMAN
You got this tape from Dr. Jacoby's office.
JAMES
Yes sir.
TRUMAN
That's breaking and entering, James.
JAMES
The door was open.
TRUMAN
How did you know Jacoby wouldn't be there?
JAMES
I knocked, nobody answered.
TRUMAN
You were alone?



 
JAMES
Yes.
Pause.
TRUMAN
James, maybe you had your reasons. You realize we may
not see it that way. Especially with three ounces of
cocaine in your gas tank.
JAMES
You know I didn't put that there.
TRUMAN
I know what I'd like to believe. I also know you were
seeing Laura the last few weeks, which means you could
have been mixed up in anything.
JAMES
Uncle Ed know I'm in here?
TRUMAN
I haven't told him yet.
(pause)
Nadine took an overdose of pills last night. She's in the
hospital. Ed's with her. I didn't want to tell him about
this.
JAMES
She gonna be all right?
TRUMAN
They don't know yet.
JAMES
Poor Nadine.
TRUMAN
James, if there's anything else you want to tell me, this
would be a good time.
JAMES
(thinks, nods)
Laura talks on her tape about a "mystery man."
TRUMAN
The Red Corvette. Leo Johnson.



 (2)
JAMES
I think it's somebody else. Not Jacques Renault either.
TRUMAN
Who?
JAMES
I never put it together until I heard the tape, where she
said "this guy can really light my fire?" She said
something once about a friend of her father's.
Somebody she'd known since she was a kid. She said
this guy was really into fire.
TRUMAN
What did she mean by that?
JAMES
I don't know. Laura said a lot of nutty stuff. Most of
the time it went right by you.
Cooper enters the room, still walking strangely, followed by Hawk.
COOPER
James, let's get right to the point. You found something
else in Jacoby's office. I want it. Give it to me.
James looks at Truman, looks back at Cooper. Cooper holds out his hand.
COOPER 
Come on.
James takes out the half-a-heart necklace, puts it in Cooper's hand.
JAMES
That was with the tape.
COOPER
Very good. Hawk, take James back to his cell.
JAMES
You gonna book me?
COOPER
We're going to talk about it.
Hawk leads James out. Truman stares at him. Cooper examines the necklace.



 (3)
TRUMAN
How'd you know he had the necklace?
COOPER
Harry, do you know what they call it when preparation
meets opportunity?
TRUMAN
Give me a minute ...
COOPER
Luck. The residue of hard work. Come on, I've got
something to show you.
TRUMAN
(as they exit, memorizing)
"Luck is the residue of hard work."
COOPER
That's the ticket.
CUT TO:
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Wearing, dark glasses, Donna is standing near the front desk, Lucy's behind the desk, Andy's
in the coffee area, as Cooper and Truman come around the corner.
COOPER
Lucy, Andy, I need you in the conference room ...
LUCY
(as she follows them in)
Agent Cooper, Doc Hayward called from the hospital,
he said Dr. Jacoby is conscious and that if you wanted to
question him now you could come over to the hospital They're now in the conference room. The box that came for Cooper in the mail is open on
the table.
COOPER
Thank you, Lucy. Is Donna here to see James?
LUCY
Yes.
Cooper nods to Truman, who gets the message and exits the room. Cooper opens the box
and empties the contents on the table.



 
COOPER
This is every edition of "Flesh World" published in the
last three years.
(takes a picture from his pocket, displays it)
This is a picture of Theresa Banks, the first victim of our
killer, who you'll recall was found a year ago in the
southern part of the state. We already know Ronette and
Laura's picture appeared in ads in the magazine ANDY
You want us to look for a picture of Theresa Banks.
COOPER
Andy, you're way ahead of me.
Andy smiles pridefully at Lucy, then remembers how upset he is and cancels the look.
COOPER 
Lucy, we'll be at the hospital.
(takes out his recorder as he exits)
Diane, I've just received the back issues issues of "Flesh
World." Good work. It's nice to see some cooperation
with the law, especially from a company that preys on
human weaknesses Andy and Lucy look at each other. Look at the magazines. Any assignment but this.
CUT TO:
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HOLDING CELL AREA - DAY
Hawk unlocks the door, lets Donnna into the corridor outside James' cell, then quietly
retreats.
DONNA
How you doing?
JAMES
Did you tell them anything?
DONNA
They haven't asked me anything.
She takes out a cigarette. Lights it. James is mildly surprised.
JAMES
When did you start smoking?



 
DONNA
I smoke every once in a while. Helps relieve the tension.
JAMES
(doesn't like this)
Uh-huh.
DONNA
So, did you tell them anything?
JAMES
I didn't tell them about you or Maddy.
DONNA
Do they think Leo killed Laura?
JAMES
I don't know what they think. How's Maddy?
DONNA
She's all right. She hasn't said anything either. I heard
them say Jacoby's conscious, they're going to question
him.
JAMES
Great.
Donna stubs the cigarette out on a bar, peeks at him over the dark glasses.
DONNA
So ... don't you want to kiss me?
They look at each other. James leans forward and kisses her tenderly through the bars; she
responds agressively, grabs him, hot. He pulls back and looks at her, puzzled.
DONNA 
(slightly teasing)
What's wrong?
JAMES
Nothing's wrong.
DONNA
Or is it just not okay for me to want you?
They look at each other, James a little uncertain. She smiles, pushes her dark glasses back up.



 (2)
DONNA 
Get out soon, James.
She bites his finger and leaves the room. James watches her go.

CUT TO:
 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Bobby kicks out the doorstop, closes the door, moves to Shelly's bed. She's lying asleep.
Bobby takes a small bouquet from under his jacket, holds it under her nose. She stirs.
BOBBY
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
She opens her eyes, sees him.
SHELLY
Bobby?
He kisses her. She lets herself be swept up for a moment, then remembers ...
SHELLY 
Bobby, what are you doing here? What if somebody sees
you?
BOBBY
I don't care. I don't care anymore.
SHELLY
Leo's in the hospital. Somebody shot him.
BOBBY
I know. I mean, I heard. What happened to you?
SHELLY
Bobby, he tried to kill me. He knew about us, he took
me to the mill. He tied me up and left me there and
started the fire - he said he was gonna kill you.
BOBBY
Far chance. Are you all right?
SHELLY
Doctors seem to think so.



 
BOBBY
Shelly, the only way you're gonna get out of here pronto
is if you let Bobby be your doctor.
(grabs a stethescope off the bed post)
Now let's just have a look here, miss, shall we?
He lifts her bedclothes, separates her gown, looks down at her.
BOBBY 
I think you're coming along splendidly.
He breathes once on the stethescope, erotically places it on her chest.
BOBBY 
Deep breath ... that's a girl, deep breath ... that's fine ...
He swoops down for a kiss. She responds.
BOBBY 
I'd say you're on your way to a complete recovery.
They kiss again. She laughs. They hear VOICES in the hallway outside.
SHELLY
You'd better go.
BOBBY
You're my girl.
SHELLY
(the first time she's said it)
I love you, Bobby.
He pauses,
BOBBY
I guess I love you, too.
He puts the flowers in a medical jar by her bedside and quickly splits to the hallway.

 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Bobby slips away as Cooper [, ALBERT] and Truman come around the corner. Cooper
[Truman] catches a glimpse of Bobby.



 
COOPER [TRUMAN]
Bobby Briggs.
TRUMAN [COOPER]
What's he doing here?
COOPER [TRUMAN]
He didn't look sick.
They look at each other. They move on, find Doc Hayward at the coffee bar.
[ALBERT]
[To see this kind of investigative genius at work, this a]
[real treat for me.]
[They look at him and move on. They find Ed Hurley at the coffee bar, across the hall from]
[Nadine's room.]
COOPER
Doc, who was Bobby Briggs visiting?
HAYWARD
I didn't even know he was here.
TRUMAN
How's it going, Doc?
HAYWARD
Thank god for the coffee bean.
COOPER
(pouring one for himself)
Doc, you said a mouthful.
HAYWARD
I still think you ought to be resting.
TRUMAN
How does that saying go, is it no rest for the weary?
COOPER
I thought it was no rest for the wicked.
HAYWARD
I never could get that straight.
Cooper looks in the room across the hall at intensive care, at Ed Hurley, sitting by Nadine's
bedside.
COOPER
Excuse me for a moment...
Cooper moves stiffly into the room across the hall.

CUT TO:

 INT. INTENSIVE HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY



Cooper knocks gently on the doorframe. Ed, seated by the bed, holding Nadine's hand. Ed
glances back at him.
ED
Agent Cooper ...
COOPER
(moving to him)
Ed ... how is she [Nadine]?
ED
(almost a whisper)
She's in a coma. They say there's nothing else we can
do. She has to want to come back.
Cooper puts a hand on Ed's shoulder.
ED 
I don't know why I'm whispering ...
COOPER
How are you?
ED
(pause, summing up succinctly)
All I can do is think about the things I should have said
or done.
COOPER
Don't be too hard to yourself
ED
I never believed in fate. I always thought you make
your own way, you take care of your own and you clean
up after yourself.
COOPER
Sound advice.
[ALBERT]
[Farmer's almanac?].
ED
So you see, for me to say to myself now that Nadine's
had an appointment with those pills from the get-go ...
(struggling with his emotions)
just to make myself feel better ... that's about as low
as a man can sink. I saw this coming and didn't want to
believe it. What's worse is, I'm sitting here thinking
maybe there's some part of me that didn't want to stop




 
ED 
her. That's a full load.
COOPER
(nods, pause)
When did you get married, Ed?
ED
Right out of high school. See, Norma and I'd been together
all through school [four years]. Everybody figured we'd get
hitched, that'd be that, I barely knew Nadine to say hello
to. That spring, one bad weekend, Norma ran off with Hank.
I was so twisted up inside I couldn't see straight. When I
opened my eyes there was Nadine right in front of me.
There was something so ... sweet and helpless about her.
We drove all night. Ended up in some little town in
Montana, out past Great Falls ... I asked her to marry
me, half-joking, half-drunk, half-crazy. It was getting
light when we found a Justice of the Peace.
(pause)
Norma, she ... she hadn't even slept with Hank. The
look on her face when she found out ...
(pause)
Nadine and I, we went up to my Dad's old cabin, up in
Eagle Pass. Honeymoon. I was hoping maybe we'd get
around to talking about an anullment, a divorce,
anything. But Nadine was so happy.
(pause)
The first day we went hunting pheasant. Wanted to bag our
own dinner. Nadine was a crack shot. We had two birds
already, but I felt good shooting, liked the way the sound
echoed and rolled down those hills. I fired. A piece of
buckshot skipped off a rock and caught her square in the eye.
(pause)
She laid across my lap as I drove us back to town. She
never cried, never blamed me, never hated me for it.
'Couple months later, Norma married Hank.
(pause)
I don't believe in fate. You make your bed. You sleep in it.
Cooper's moved. Ed strokes Nadine's cheek, moves a strand of hair. A soft knock on the
door. [Albert takes out a handkerchief, pretends to dab at his eyes.]
TRUMAN [HAWK'S VOICE]
Ed? Someone here to see you.
[He turns. James steps into view. We see Hawk in background. Ed and James embrace.]
[Cooper, Truman and Albert withdraw.]

He turns. James steps into the doorway. We see Hawk in background. Ed rises. He and
James embrace. Cooper withdraws from the room.
CUT TO:
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Cooper [, Albert] and Truman walk slowly away. Cooper shakes his head.
TRUMAN
(to Hawk, quietly)
Take James back when they're done.
Hawk nods. Cooper and Truman continue on.
COOPER
Poor Ed. Poor Nadine.
TRUMAN
(says volumes)
Yeah.
They move around the corner.
CUT TO:
 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Cooper and Truman enter. DR. JACOBY is lying in bed, hooked up to various monitors, but
sitting up, rested, alert. Doc Hayward is seated by his bedside. He rises, Cooper takes his
seat.
JACOBY
(notices he's moving slowly)
What happened to you?
HAYWARD
I'll see about some coffee.
TRUMAN
Thanks, Doc.
Cooper and Truman take seats beside Jacboy's bed.
COOPER
Dr. Jacoby, I know you've been through quite a bit in the
last twenty-four hours. So have I. I don't want to
pussyfoot around with you anymore or see any more




 
COOPER 
magic tricks or hear anymore psychological mumbojumbo. I want you to tell us how you came into
possession of this
Cooper reveals the half-a-heart necklace. Jacoby is saddened seeing it, holds it gently in his
hands.
JACOBY
Shall I start at the beginning?
COOPER
That's as good a place as any.
JACOBY
Laura started coming to see me nine months ago. On her
own. Picked my name out of the phone book. I thought,
what in the world could be troubling such a bright,
pretty girl?
COOPER
And?
JACOBY
Laura was, in essence, living a double life; two people,
self-divided, and those two selves were literally at war.
A war of attrition. And the part of her that was good
and loving was gradually losing ground.
COOPER
Why?
JACOBY
Because the other self was stronger. The last time I saw
her, two days before her death, it seemed to me she had
reached a kind of peace with herself. I now believe that
what she had in fact arrived at was a decision to end her
life.
TRUMAN
Suicide?
COOPER
She didn't kill herself.
JACOBY
No. She allowed herself to be killed.



 (2)
TRUMAN
I don't understand.
JACOBY
She had reached a point where her good self believed
that death was the only way to prevent the other side
from complete domination. Death, in this sense,
represented a kind of victory.
TRUMAN
Good Lord ...
COOPER
(alert, moving him along)
The necklace ...
JACOBY
As I told you,the night after she died, I followed a man
in a red corvette.
COOPER
Leo Johnson.
JACOBY
Correct. He eluded me near the Old Sawmill Road.
As I sat there cursing my lack of horsepower, a
motorcycle drove by COOPER
James and Donna.
JACOBY
Which I discovered after following them, on foot, into
the woods. They spoke intently for a while, I couldn't
hear them, then they buried something in the ground and
drove away.
CUT TO:
 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (FROM PILOT)
MOVING POV, a flashlight beam travels along the ground, finds the white rock. A gloved
hand reaches down and takes the necklace.
JACOBY'S VOICE
(over)
Unable to quench my curiosity, I dug down and found
the necklace. I had seen it around Laura's neck many




 
JACOBY'S VOICE 
times. Perhaps ill-advisedly, I took it as a keepsake.
CUT TO:
 DR. JACOBY
Tears in his eyes, looking at the necklace in his hand.
JACOBY
This was her, you see. The necklace. A divided heart.
Pause. Cooper gently takes it from him.
COOPER
(more gently)
One more thing. You were in this room with Jacques
when he was killed.
JACOBY
Yes. Heavily sedated.
TRUMAN
Did you see or hear anything?
JACOBY
I can remember hearing the fire alarm go off.
(tries to think)
That's all, I ... it's all like a dream, I'm sorry. Wait, I
... there was a smell, a peculiar smell.
COOPER
When he died, Jacques voided his bowels.
JACOBY
No. This was like oil. Like scorched engine oil.
Truman and Cooper look at each other.
CUT TO:
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Cooper and Truman walk.
COOPER
Harry, let's get a hold of Albert. We'll meet back at
the station. I'm ready to lay the whole thing out.



 
TRUMAN
Rocks and bottles?
COOPER
Chalk and the blackboard will be just fine.
They move around the corner out of sight.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Maybe some doughnuts.
COOPER'S VOICE
That goes without saying.
We PICK UP and STAY WITH Norma, just leaving Shelly's room, calling back to her.
NORMA
I'll come back later and bring you some soup. The food
in this place'll kill you quicker than most diseases.
SHELLY
You know, I got a real sweet tooth, too.
NORMA
I've got some fresh choclate/peanut butter pie.
SHELLY
Norma, I'm serious: bring the whole pie.
NORMA
Feel better, sweetie.
SHELLY
I do already.
NORMA
Bye-bye.
Norma moves down the corridor. She stops outside Nadine's room, sees Ed at her bedside,
holding Nadine's hand. She watches them for a moment, then slowly pulls away from the
door.

FADE IN:
 EXT. DINER - DAY
Bobby Briggs enters the diner, looks around, moves to the counter and hears ...
MAJOR BRIGGS' VOICE
Son?
Bobby turns. The Major is sitting in a booth, enjoying a cup of coffee and some pie, a napkin
in his shirt front.
BOBBY
(surprised)
Dad?
An awkward moment.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Would you ... care to join me?
Bobby looks around. No escape.
BOBBY
Yeah, okay.
Bobby slumps into the booth across from his father.
MAJOR BRIGGS
How was school today?
BOBBY
School? Oh. Fine.
MAJOR BRIGGS
That's good.
The Major takes another bite of pie. A brief lull.
BOBBY
How was work?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Work? Work was good.
Another hiatus. More pie.



 
BOBBY
Dad?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes, son.
BOBBY
What is it that you do, exactly?
MAJOR BRIGGS
That's classified.
BOBBY
Oh.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Bobby, would you care for a piece of pie? The huckleberries are
particularly delicious today.
BOBBY
No, thanks.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Particularly fresh and delicious.
More pie and a pause.
BOBBY
This is so weird.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Oh, I've been coming here for Norma's pie and coffee
for many years. It's a short drive from the base, roughly
twelve minutes if the lights are with you. At one time, I
was nearly what you might call a habitue.
BOBBY
You don't say.
Finishing his pie, Major Briggs tidily wipes the corners of his mouth, pushes his plate away
and folds his napkin.
MAJOR BRIGGS
The gospel truth. Son, may I share something with you?
BOBBY
Not the pie.



 (2)
MAJOR BRIGGS
A vision I had in my sleep last night. As distinguished
from a dream, which is a mere sorting and cataloguing
of the day's events by the subconscious; a vision, fresh
and clear as a mountain stream, the mind revealing itself
to itself.
BOBBY
Uh-huh.
MAJOR BRIGGS
In my vision I was on the verandah of a vast estate, a
palazzo of some fantastic proportion. There seemed to
emanate from it, a light from within this gleaming,
radiant marble. I ha known this place. I had, in fact,
been born and raised there and this was my first return, a
reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being. As I
wandered about I noticed happily that the house had
been immaculately maintained and there had been
added to it a number of additional rooms but in a way
that blended in so seamlessly with the original
construction one would never detect any difference.
Returning to the house's grand foyer, there came a knock
at the door. I opened it. My son was standing there. It
wasn't you, but in a way it was. He was happy and
carefree, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy.
We embraced, a warm and loving embrace, nothing
witheld. We were, in this moment, one. My vision
ended and I awoke with an overwhelming feeling of
optimism and confidence about you and your future.
That was my vision of you.
BOBBY
(touched in spite of himself)
Really.
MAJOR BRIGGS
I'm so glad I've had this opporunity to share it with
you.
Major Briggs rises and extends a hand. He and Bobby shakes hands.
MAJOR BRIGGS 
I wish you nothing but the very best in all things.
BOBBY
Thank you.



 (3)
MAJOR BRIGGS
I'll see you later at home.
BOBBY
Okay.
Major Briggs moves off to pay his bill. Hank mans the register.
HANK
How was everything?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Exceptional, as always.
HANK
Great.
Major Briggs tips his hat, gives Bobby a happy wave and exits. Bobby waves back, sits in the
booth, trying to add this up to a round figure.
Norma enters the diner, clearly upset. She moves behind the counter, starts towards the
back.
HANK
How was she? ... Norma?
NORMA
(close to tears)
I can't talk right now.
She disappears into the kitchen. Hank gives a look to Bobby, a conspiritorial shrug
("women") before moving off. Bobby returns it, before remembering where he last saw
Hank.

 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The blackboard is set up at one end of the room. Truman,
Hawk and Andy enter and take seats at the opposite end of the table. A tearful Lucy enters
with a platter of doughnuts which she sets down on the table. Everyone takes one.
Cooper looks at his watch. Albert enters the room, sets down his briefcase.
ALBERT
(no apology here)
Oh. Was I late?
COOPER
Have a seat, Albert. Albert, Harry, jump in any time;
we're going to reconstruct the last hours of Laura Palmer.
Cooper flips over the squeaky blackboard. A map of the town featuring a number of
symbols, houses, etc. have been drawn on the board.
COOPER 
Lucy, if you could man the pointer, I need to sit down.
He takes out his collapsible pointer, telescopes it to full length, hands it to Lucy and sits.
Lucy stands in front of the board, blows her nose.
COOPER 
We'll keep this simple, Lucy. When I say something,
you point to it.
LUCY
(weepy)
I'll try my best.
Andy looks pained.
COOPER
On the afternoon of February 23, Laura left school at
approximately 2:30 in the afternoon ...
Lucy points to a drawing of a building with "HIGH SCHOOL" printed beneath it.
COOPER 
She proceeded by family car to the Double R Diner.
Lucy points, etc.
CUT TO:


 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
MOS flashback. Laura picks up two large paper bags from Norma at the counter.

them to nine shut-ins around town as part of the Meals on
Wheels program.
CUT TO:
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Lucy points to six small "buildings" scattered around the map.
COOPER 
At the conclusion of which she drove to the Blue Pine
Lodge ... where she gave Josie Packard an English lesson.
ALBERT
You might consider making them manditory for all the
townsfolk.
(draws stares)
Just a suggestion.
COOPER
Laura then returned home ... she dined with her parents.
At 7:00 that evening she drove to Bobby Briggs' house.
She and Bobby did homework together until 9:
ALBERT
(to Truman, trying to get a rise)
What do you think, Sheriff: trigonometry?
TRUMAN
Bobby claims it was civics.
ALBERT
That seems much more likely.
COOPER
At which Laura drove home.

 INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
MOS flashback. Laura walks through the room, says good night to Sarah, and starts up the




 
stairs.
COOPER'S VOICE

She said goodnight to her mother and went upstairs. A
few minutes later she received a phone call.
Sarah looks at the phone.
COOPER'S VOICE

Mrs. Palmer did not see her leave, but according to
James Hurley she snuck out of the house on foot and met
him here near the Roadhouse on Highway 21 ...
CUT TO:
 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
MOS flashback. Laura hops on the back of James bike and they ride off.
CUT TO:
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Cooper holds up Laura's diary.
COOPER
In her diary, Laura had written "nervous about meeting
"J" tonite." I now believe this was a reference to James
Hurley, she was nervous because she planned to tell him
she didn't want to see him anymore.
(Lucy sniffles back a sob)
They drove up into the woods near the Old Sawmill
road ... their conversation lasted approximately two
hours. James drove them back down the hill.
CUT TO:
 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
MOS flashblack. James stops the bike. Laura screams something at him and jumps off. He
tries to pursue her and she runs away.
COOPER'S VOICE

At 12:30, at the intersection of Sparkwood and 21,
Laura jumped off the bike and ran away.
CUT TO


 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
COOPER
This much we know as fact. What follows now is our
best reconstruction.
Nods to Albert.
ALBERT
Laura left Sparkwood and 21 on foot, to an unspecified
location, where, as prearranged ...
CUT TO:
 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
MOS flashback. Laura moves around a dark corner, comes upon Leo Johnson standing next
to his Corvette, smoking cigarette. He grabs her, roughs her up a little, indicates she's late.
She kisses him. He puts her in the car and they drive off.
ALBERT'S VOICE 
... she met Leo Johnson, the person who called her earlier.
They drove off together.
CUT TO:
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
LUCY
(reluctant to work for Albert)
Do you still want me to point?
ALBERT
I so wish you would.
COOPER
Yes, Lucy.
ALBERT
Leo Johnson was Laura's source for cocaine. He was also
involved in Laura's bunco scheme, come-ins for cash in
"Flesh World" magazine, with ads featuring pictures of
both Laura and Ronette Pulaski.
He holds up an order edition of "Flesh World" pointing out the item in question.
COOPER
And thanks to Deputy Andy Brennan's fine eye for
detail, we now know that an ad featuring a picture of




 
COOPER 
Theresa Banks, the killer's first victim ran in the six
editions of "Flesh World" before her death a year ago.
Under Laura's ring fingernail we found the letter "r".
Lucy points to the letter "r" written on the board, then the letter "t."
ALBERT
Under Theresa's ring fingernail was found the letter "t."
Positive triangulate linkage.
Andy beams. Lucy sniffles again.
ALBERT 
Good work, Andy. Woof.
COOPER
Leo drove Laura to a location somewhere near the Pearl
Lakes off Highway J, at the foot of the trail leading to
Jacques Renault's cabin.
Lucy points again.
COOPER 
... they met Jacques and Ronnette Pulaski here and
climbed the trail to Jacques' cabin, where they were
heard passing by the cabin of Margaret the Log Lady.
They reached the cabin at approximately one a.m. They
partied; drugs and liquor were consumed. Laura was
tied up and had sexual relations with both Leo and
Jacques. Waldo, Jacques's bird, was let out of his cage
and attacked Laura. Leo and Jacques fought. Jacques
went outside and passed out. When he came to, Leo and
the girls were gone.
Cooper rises stiffly.
COOPER 
The Log Lady heard a Third Man pass by her cabin,
go up the hill. This Third Man witnessed the events
in the cabin, watching through a window.
ALBERT
There were footprints outside the one window with a
clear view of the room.
COOPER
I believe that after his fight with Jacques, Leo left the




 (2)
COOPER 
cabin, alone, walked back to his car and drove off.
Laura was still tied up when the Third Man entered the
cabin.
TRUMAN
It wasn't Jacques or Leo?
COOPER
Laura had ten thousand dollars in her safe deposit box. I
believe that was drug money she owed to Leo. Leo
wouldn't have killed her without first collecting that
money. Leo also has an ironclad alibi for the night
Theresa Banks was murdered. He was in jail, in Twin
Peaks, on an assault charge.
ALBERT
The Third Man took Laura and Ronette to the train car,
here, on foot, a mile and half away.
Lucy points.
ALBERT 
He wore surgical gloves, he was thorough, he was careful.
The girls did not struggle until they were inside.
COOPER
Suggesting they knew the man.
ALBERT
They were tied up again at the train car; Laura for the
second time, Ronette for the first.
TRUMAN
Finley's fine twine.
ALBERT

was also smart.

knocking her unconscious. Then he killed Laura. He
took his time; over an hour.

COOPER
During the course of which, Ronette came to, managed
to crawl out of the cabin into the woods and eventually
to safety. The Man didn't know or didn't care that
Ronette was gone.
ALBERT
He cleaned up. He built a mound of dirt, just as he had
with Theresa Banks. He left a note written in Laura's
blood. Washed his hands in the rainwater pooled
outside. My men also found these outside ...
Holds up an evidence bag containing water damaged scraps of paper.
ALBERT 
Scraps of paper. Hand torn, scattered around the area.
Ink washed away by the rain. Commercial quality.
TRUMAN
From what?
COOPER
(a guess)
Letters? Personal papers?
ALBERT
Attempting to implicate Leo Johnson, he wrapped
Laura's body in plastic that was taken from Leo's house
or car. He carried the body to Elk River a quarter
of a mile away and threw her in.
Lucy is too saddened to point. Cooper points.
COOPER 
The body floated downriver into Black Lake and
washed up outside the Blue Pine Lodge.

Harry pats him gently on the back.
ALBERT
It's what we call a three-hankie crime.
ANDY
(finally boiling over)
You think you're so smart - why don't you just shut up!
Everyone's surprised by Andy's outburst, no one more so than Andy. Andy exits. Albert

PETE
I sure appreciate the ride, Harry.
TRUMAN
No problem.
PETE

Smoke inhalation's a nasty business; I feel like
somebody taped my lips to the tailpipe of a bus.
Pete sits wearily down at the kitchen counter, wipes his brow.
TRUMAN
Can I get you something to wet your whistle?
PETE
I'm feeling a little reckless; there's be a couple 'a ginger
beers in the fridge.
Truman gets the drinks. Pete finds a note the counter, in an envelope addressed to him.
TRUMAN
So Pete ... where the hell is Josie?
Truman sets down the drink on the counter. Pete opens the envelope.
PETE
Maybe this'll tell you.
(reads the note)
"Dear Pete, I had to leave the town on an emergency of
business to Seattle. I will phone you when I arrive.
Hope you did a good day at the mill; there is ginger
beer in the refridge ... love, Josie." There you go.




TRUMAN
When did you see her last?
PETE
I didn't see her at all yesterday. 'Note's dated
yesterday afternoon.
TRUMAN
No forwarding number? No way to tell her about the
mill?
PETE
No. She heads over to Seattle once every three months
or so. Want my opinion she goes there to indulge a
secret vice.
TRUMAN
What is it?
PETE
(confidentially)
Shopping. Comes back with half a department store.
He chuckles. Sees Truman hasn't moved off his concern.
PETE 
Guess we're both a little sweet on her.
Truman nods. Next piece of business.
TRUMAN
Pete. We haven't found Catherine.
PETE
Yeah. 'Figured.
TRUMAN
The last place anybody saw her's under fifty tons of
twisted steel. It could take weeks to sift through. You
can hope for the best, but you ought to prepare or the
worst.
Pete nods. It hits him.
PETE
(surprised by the strength of his emotion)
Oh dear...

TRUMAN
If there's anything I can do to help ...
Pause.
PETE
Always thought I'd be the first to go. If you'd laid
odds on the last person standing in a nuclear war I
would'a bet on her.
TRUMAN
I'm so sorry.
PETE
No point in mincing words. She was hell to live with.
But once there was a little bit of heaven there, too.
TRUMAN
She was tough.
PETE
Oh God. This'll take a while to sink in, I suppose.
TRUMAN
Suppose it will.

Oh God. I loved her. God help her miserable soul, I

I'm sorry, she's not here right now 


 
ASIAN MAN
Can you tell me when she'll be back?
TRUMAN
She's out of town. I can try and get a message to her;

The Asian Man hangs up. We stay with him. He thinks. He picks up the phone and dials.
ASIAN MAN

I'd like to place an international call please ... collect to
Hong Kong.
Behind him, elevator doors open; Ben and Jerry emerge. Jerry's carrying a small box. We
stay with them.
JERRY

the entire head, they dip it in this kind of blancmange
pudding, roll it in oats, stuff it full of walnuts, hot rocks

prepared to hand over to her as soon Josie gives us a John
Hancock (to Hank)

HANK
She took a powder last night.
BEN
Prearranged?
HANK
She wanted a little distance between her and the smell of
smoke. She'll be back as soon as it blows over.
BEN
Sound strategy. You're keeping a tight leash?
HANK
I gave her something to think about.
BEN
Your other business with her is satisfactorily concluded?
HANK
The short answer is yes.
Jerry offers the contents of his box: candied apples.
JERRY
Boys, a local work of genius: tree-ripened Granny
Smith's, dipped in hot, hand-pulled creme caramel,
dusted with crushed nuts and a dark coco powder.
Enjoy.
They each eagerly take one and bite in. The caramel slows down their speech.

BEN
A phenomenal taste sensation.
JERRY
Huh? Huh?
HANK
Very good.
BEN
(between bites)
Next business: Leo Johnson.
HANK
He's in a coma. Looks like brain damage.
JERRY
With Leo, how could they tell?
BEN
Why isn't he on the last train to the Elysian Fields?
HANK
I caught him center-shot with a . Couldn't risk going
inside. The neighborhood was hot, I had to sneak past
patrols as it was.
BEN
Did he see you?
HANK
Negative. He was chopping wood.
JERRY
Inside?
HANK
Hey. You know Leo.
BEN
(moving on)
What else? Catherine Packard: dead?
HANK
My call put her in the drying shed when it went up.
Sounds like she's buried in the wreckage.

BEN
Marvelous. If they don't hang the arson on the late,
lamented Catherine and her "co-conspirator" Leo I'll
give up sex.
JERRY
(finishing his apple)
That's ... confidence.
Hank lifts Catherine's illicit mill ledger off the desk.
HANK
What do we do with the ledger?

Sarah and Leland are dressed for an evening out. Leland is deftly spinning Sarah around the
room with a few light dance steps, humming some public domain tune. Sarah is smiling and
enjoying it in spite of herself.
Maddy and Donna watch from the doorway to the room. Leland finishes the dance.
LELAND
Come on, doll, let's paint the town.




SARAH
(not complaining)
Leland, I don't know what's gotten in to you.
LELAND
That old black magic's got me in its spell.
SARAH
Something has, that much is for sure.
LELAND
Girls, you should have seen Sarah dance. We used to win
all the dance contests down at the Grange Hall; the other
couples would see us coming and just walk off the floor.
SARAH
Leland ...
LELAND
It's true - isn't it true?
SARAH
(to Maddy)
We won't be late.
MADDY
Say hi to the Haywards for me.
DONNA
I'll probably see you over there.
Leland gives Maddy a kiss, dances Sarah through the archway towards the front door,
humming another tune.
DONNA
(breaking out the smokes)
I half expected him to start dancing up the walls like
Fred Astaire.
MADDY
It's nice to see them enjoying themselves.
Donna pulls out a list; they sit on the sofa.
DONNA
So listen, I got hold of the list of Meals on Wheels
clients that Laura used to visit. It used to be nine, now
it's eight since old Mr. Pendergast died.

MADDY
What are you gonna do?
DONNA
I told Norma I'd take over the deliveries tomorrow,
I'll spend some time with everybody on her route ...
She unfolds a small town map.
DONNA 
I put x's on all the addresses. One of these eight
people must have sent me that note; that means they
know something. We just have to figure out who it was.
As Donna concentrates over her map, Maddy feels an odd, disquieting feeling come over her.
She tries to shake it off, can't. SOUND of Donna's voice grows fainter.
DONNA 
Laura never talked much about them. Guess we know by
now that doesn't necessarily mean there wasn't anything
weird about them ...
Maddy turns slowly and looks into the alcove of the living room. Standing there, stock still,
is BOB, the grey-haired man we've seen in Cooper's dream and Mrs. Palmer's vision.
Maddy's frozen with fear. Donna doesn't immediately notice. Maddy starts to tremble,
unable to speak. Bob doesn't move. He just looks at her.
Donna finally notices her distress.
DONNA 
Maddy? ... Maddy?
MADDY
(turning to her)
Huh?
DONNA
What is it? What's wrong?
Maddy just looks at her, looks back. Bob is gone.

Here, you can just put some of the dishes in my lap.

Oh, no, I don't mind, it's no trouble.
LELAND
Now Eileen, I've been looking forward to one of your
deserts all day; I hope you won't disappoint me.
EILEEN
Leland, you know me better than that.
SARAH
I'll give you a hand.
Eileen wheels towards the kitchen; Sarah follows.
SARAH 
Let's put on a pot of decaf.
EILEEN
I've got both if you want regular.
They're gone. Leland looks over at Doc. Doc's got an elbow on the table, propping up his
chin. He's sound asleep. His chin slips, he wakes with a start.
LELAND
Long day, Will?
DOC
I feel like I've sat through back to back operas.
LELAND
Terrible about the mill.



 
DOC
They say over a hundred and fifty jobs may be lost.
LELAND
Awful.
DOC
(gently probing)
I suppose that opens the door for Ben Horne and his big
development plans.
LELAND
(good natured)
As his lawyer, and yours, of course I can't comment.
DOC
As your doctor, Leland, what the hell happened to your
hair?
LELAND
Isn't it strange? I woke up this morning, looked in the
mirror and there it was, literally changed overnight.
DOC
Considering all you've been through ...
LELAND
It's a funny thing, though. Seeing it I seemed to realize
I'd turned a corner somehow. I felt a great deal of
sadness still, yes, but it wasn't as overwhelming; I
actual physcially felt as if a large weight had been
lifted from my heart.
DOC
Perhaps it has.
LELAND
Perhaps it has. God, I feel like singing.
DOC
That would be very nice. We always enjoy hearing you
sing, Leland.
LELAND
You know me, Will; it was either law school or
Broadway.
Eileen and Sarah return from the kitchen, bearing coffee and desert.

DOC
Eileen, Leland would like to favor us with a song.
EILEEN
Oh, I'd really enjoy that.
LELAND
(asking for accompaniment)
Sarah?
SARAH
Of course, dear.
EILEEN
Let's move into the living room, shall we?
They do. Doc sits facing the piano. Eileen beside him. Sarah sits down at the piano. Leland
whispers something to her, she nods.
LELAND
Excuse me just one second.
Leland disappears into the foyer for a moment. Sarah gets a signal from him and starts to
play the intro to "Get Happy."
Leland enters with a hat and cane. He sings "Get Happy," hoofs a little, not inexpertly. Doc
and Eileen seem to enoy it a great deal. As he enters the second verse Leland's tempo picks
up and accelerates, heading towards manic. Sarah has trouble keeping up.
Doc and Eileen try to smile through it. At the end of the second verse, at fever pitch, Leland
keels over and passes out on the floor. Doc and Sarah rush to him.
SARAH
Oh dear ...
Doc loosens Leland's collar, slaps his checks.
DOC
Sarah, if you could just get me my bag.
Eileen is alreay wheeling her way to them with it.
EILEEN
Got it right here.
DOC
I'm sure it's nothing serious ...

Doc rummages through his bag for some smelling salts.
SARAH
(at a bit of a loss)
He's been singing all day. Mostly old songs.
Doc waves some of the salts in front of Leland's nose. He immediately revives, looks up at
them all and smiles.

Cooper exits his bathroom, moving very stiffly. He sits painfully on the side of the bed and
takes a handful of aspirins with his glass of warm milk. He picks up his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, it's 11:55 p.m., approximately nineteen hours
since the shooting incident that nearly caused me to
make a premature purchase of the proverbial farm.
There's every reason to think I'll make a complete
recovery, which I would like to get a good jump out of
the blocks on by sleeping solidly for at least eight or
nine hours ... a man can only go so long without
submitting to a period of rest ...
As he speaks, he puts in his ear plugs.
COOPER 
... for as we know from experiments performed on
American GI's during the Korean War, sleep deprivation
is a one-way ticket to temporary psychosis and I'm
working on a three day jag. I got so goofy last night as I
was lying here wondering whether I was going to live or
die that I thought I saw a giant in my room, but perhaps
I'll save that story for another time.
(a big yawn)
This is me, room 315 of the Great Northern Hotel,
signing off.
Cooper puts a sleep mask and turns off the lamp. He lies still for a moment. He thinks he
feels a weight settle on the end of the bed. He turns, senses sometrhing. He lifts the corner of
the sleep mask and sees ...
... the Giant is back. Sitting at the end of the bed.
GIANT
Sorry to wake you.
COOPER
I wasn't asleep. I'm not asleep. Then I'm not dreaming.



 
GIANT
I forgot to tell you something.
COOPER
You were right about Jacques. The big rubber bag.
GIANT
The things I tell you will not be wrong.
Cooper's about to ask another question. The Giant raises his huge hand to still him.
GIANT 
Better to listen than to talk.
COOPER
I believe you.
GIANT
Don't search for all the answers at once. A path is
formed by laying one stone at a time.
Coopers nods.
GIANT 
One person saw the Third Man. Three have seen him,
yes, but not his body. One only. Known to you. Ready
now to speak.
Coopers wants to speak, bites his tongue. Nods.
GIANT 
One more thing. You forgot something.
COOPER
What?
The Giant waves goodbye to him.
Cooper leans over to turn on the lamp. The Giant is gone.

Cooper and Albert sit at the table arrayed with breakfast foods. Griddlecakes, orange
juice, coffee. Cooper eats, expounds. Albert listens.
COOPER
Buddhist tradition reached the Land of Snow in the fifth
century A.D. The first Tibetan king to be touched by the
Dharma was Ha-tho-tho-ri gnyan-btsan. He, and all
succeeding kings were known collectively as the Happy
Generations. Some histories place the King in the water
snake year of 213 A.D. Others in 173 A.D. A water-ox
year. Amazing, isn't it? The Happy Generations.
Cooper takes a sip of hot coffee, beams. Albert, deadpan, just stares for a very long beat.
Then, finally:
ALBERT
Agent Cooper. I'm thrilled to pieces that the Dharma
came to King Ho-Ho and the Land of Schmoes. I really
am. But right now I'm trying hard to focus on the more
immediate problems of our own century. Right here in
Twin Peaks.
COOPER
(without malice)
You'd be surprised by the connections between the two.
ALBERT
Color me amazed.
COOPER

Ronette Pulaski has come out of her coma.
ALBERT
And?







COOPER
I'm thinking Ronette has quite a story to tell, once she
regains her ability to speak.
ALBERT
She's not talking.
COOPER
Wakened, but silent. Probably shock.
Cooper pulls two police sketches out of his briefcase. Leo Johnson. And Bob, the longhaired man.
COOPER

I intend to show her these.
(re appropriate sketch)
Leo Johnson. And Bob - the man Sarah Palmer saw in her
vision. The man who came to me in my dream.
ALBERT
(the usual sour sarcasm)
Has anyone seen 'Bob' on Earth in the last few weeks?
COOPER
Not yet.
Cooper takes a big bite of griddlecake. Albert produces a report, speaks while referring to
it:
ALBERT
Fine. I performed the autopsy on Jacques Renault.
Contents of the deceased's stomach revealed beer cans, a
Maryland license plate, half a bicycle tire, a goat, and a
small wooden puppet. Goes by the name of Pinocchio.
COOPER
(delighted)
You're making a joke.
ALBERT
(deadpan)
I like to think of myself as one of the Happy Generations.
(back to report)
The killer snuffed the fat with a pillow. He was
Wearing gloves. Tape used to bind his wrists was stolen
from hospital supply closet. That's all. If Jacques has any
secrets he'll be taking them underground.

ALBERT
Preliminaries suggest arson. I nominate Leo Johnson.
COOPER
We need a statement from Shelly Johnson.
ALBERT
Hospital says she's well enough.

COOPER

ALBERT
I believe it's customary to inquire after the health of one
recently plugged with a thirty-eight. Three times.
COOPER
(almost touched)
Thanks for asking.
ALBERT
Don't get sentimental.
COOPER
(back to business)
Who shot me, Albert?
ALBERT
My men are interrogating hotel guests. The usual bumper
crop of rural know-nothings and drunken fly fishermen.
No leads so far. The world's most decrepit room service
waiter remembers nothing out-of-the-ordinary about the
night in question. No surprise there. Senor Drool Cup
has, shall we say, a mind that wanders. He The waitress interrupts, delivers a check. Cooper holds out a hand, signals he'll pay for it.

The eyes move, nothing else, to acknowledge them.

Cooper produces the two police sketches, prepatory to showing them to her.
COOPER
Ronette, I'm going to show you some pictures. I want
you to tell me if you have seen these men before. I want
to know if they are the men that hurt you.
His words spark a memory, the memory brings pain. All in her dark eyes. Cooper holds
the sketch of Leo Johnson toward her.
COOPER
Do you recognize this man?
A long beat. Then a surprise. Ronette's arm lifts into the air, as if separate from the rest of
her body. Cooper and Truman react. Ronette gingerly takes the sketch from Cooper, brings
it closer to her eyes. As if to better view it. Cooper wonders:
COOPER
(gently)
Can you see, Ronette?
Ronnette nods, almost imperceptibly. She stares at the sketch for a long, long beat.
TRUMAN
Do you know him?
A long beat. Ronette proceeds slowly, as though underwater. Finally she nods. Yes.
COOPER
Is this the man that hurt you?
Another beat. Then, finally ... she shakes her head. No.





TRUMAN
(confirming)
No.
Cooper takes the sketch from Ronette, holds out the second picture. The long-haired man
named Bob. Again, Ronette reaches for it, brings the sketch toward her face. Near-sighted,
this is the only way she can clearly see it.
SUDDENLY Ronette's entire body seems to seize, her eyes dart about wildly.
COOPER
Ronette.
Ronette drops the sketch, her hand now knifes through the air, jagged motions, up and
down, to the side, and up and down. The nurse hurries forward to aid or restrain. But
Cooper intervenes.
COOPER
(to Nurse)
Wait.
(to Truman)
She's trying to spell something. Paper.
Truman produces paper and pen, hands them to the girl. Ronette clutches the pen, begins to
scrawl.
COOPER
Ronette. Is this the man that hurt you?
Ronette nods furiously as she writes, tears stream down her checks. She finishes, holds the
paper toward them. Cooper takes it. They read.
ANGLE ON PAPER

Sounds like your wife was cookin' the books.
PETE
We couldn't find it anywhere. But I found my high school
yearbook. Midge Jones.
(beat)
Midge had blue eyes like a robin's egg. And a funny way
of walking. One foot here, one foot there, one foot here,
one foot there.
ALBERT
(he can't help himself)
Feets don't fail me now.
(beat)
Pete? Let's make a heroic attempt to keep our minds, and
what's left of yours, trained on the night in question. The
night the mill burned down.




 
Pete looks up, seems to see Albert for the first time.
PETE
I don't like you.
COOPER
(gently)
No one does, Pete.
TRUMAN
(muttered)
Amen to that.
ALBERT
Well bounce my butt out of the Glee Club. Gentlemen,
I've got a job to do.
COOPER
(to Pete)
Did Catherine tell you what was in the ledger?
PETE
Heavens no. But she was desperate to find it. Until the
phone rang and she was gone. I saw her car out front. The
mill was burning. So I went inside ...
Pete can't continue.
COOPER
I'm sorry, Pete. We all are.
PETE
Have you found ... her body?
Cooper shakes his head. No.
ALBERT
A mill fire burns somewhere close to two thousand
degrees, Mr. Martell. That's hot enough to incinerate
bone.
Cooper places a reproving hand on Albert's, stops him from continuing. Pete fixes Albert
with a baleful stare. A beat. Then, in a whisper:
PETE
Catherine's dead.
Pete sighs. Then stands, offers.




 (2)
PETE
Let me get you boys some coffee.
Pete shuffles off toward the kitchen. Cooper and Albert trade conclusions. Truman watches
quietly, as a spectator at a tennis match.
COOPER
Leo's clothing reeked of gasoline.
ALBERT
Gas cans found at the hot spot matched those in the back
of his truck.
COOPER
Catherine hired Leo to burn down the mill.
ALBERT
She gets a phone call. From Leo?
COOPER
Maybe something went wrong.
ALBERT
Wrong enough. Mill burns. Catherine with it.
COOPER
I want Shelly Johnson. She can put Leo at the scene.
Catherine too.

Meanwhile, Cooper and Albert continue. Truman spectates as before.
ALBERT
We need a look at Catherine Martell's will.
COOPER
Who stood to benefit from her death?
ALBERT
Who gets the mill? Or what's left of it.
COOPER
Life insurance.
ALBERT
I'll run the policy for beneficiaries.
Albert turns to Truman, sneers at his silence.
ALBERT
Don't be shy, Prince of Yokels. You too can participate in
the investigatory process.
Truman rises. Cooper grabs him by the arm. Just then: Pete interrupts.
PETE
(eyes on Albert)
Excuse me, boys. Coffee. Piping hot.
ALBERT
(muttered)
Morons and mooncalves, everywhere I go.
Pete carries a wooden tray into view. He speaks as he sets and pours coffee for four.
PETE
When I met Catherine, she was dating a fellow named
Rodney Pocquet. French-Canadian millionare's son.
Rich as Croesus. Rodney never said it, but he looked
down on me. I know he did. And why not? Rodney in
his fine summer suits. Me in my overalls and boots. I
never minded all that much.
(beat)
Until he started talking rude to me. Like I wasn't even
there. Rodney Pocquet hurt my feelings. He embarrassed
me in front of my friends. That made me mad.
Pete pauses, sets down the coffee pot. Albert wonders.



18A.

ALBERT
(with a sigh)
Is there a point to this insensate ramble?
PETE
Well, yes. There is. I hiked up to Rodney's big house.
And I socked him on the jaw. Rodney never talked that
way to me again.
Albert looks to Cooper and Truman. He knows what's coming.
ALBERT
Not again.
They nod. And Pete floors Albert with a slow right cross to the jaw.

OPEN ON a police flyer. The official sketch of the long-haired man named Bob. And a
headline. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN as he carefully attaches the
flyer to the inside of the Double R Diner doors. Andy's using scotch tape to affix the paper
flyer. He's managed to get a piece caught in his tufted hair. LELAND PALMER and
MADDY FERGUSON enter past Andy and move to a booth. Leland is resplendent in
sharp suit, bright white hair, and a whole new attitude. He nearly beams.




 
LELAND
Best chocolate malteds this side of the Mississippi.
MADDY
I haven't tried a malt here yet.
LELAND
Then I insist, dear. Simple pleasures. Life is too short.
NORMA JENNINGS approaches.
LELAND 
Norma, two chocolate malteds, with a dollop of
whipped cream on the top.
NORMA
You're looking well, Mr. Palmer.
LELAND
I'm feeling well, thank you.
Norma moves back to the counter. Leland recounts a happy memory.
LELAND 
Laura's favorite was a drink we used to call a Brown Cow.
It's like a root beer float only made with a cola drink
and vanilla ice cream. She had her first, with me, in that
booth right there.
MADDY
I'm glad you're feeling better, Uncle Leland.
LELAND
A man must take care of his family. And I still have a
family to take care of.
He reaches over, takes her hands. With pride.
LELAND 
I'm coming through the pain, Maddy. I'm coming
through alive.

moves behind the counter with a winning smile. Norma can't help but return it.
NORMA
What are you grinning about?




 
HANK
You.
NORMA
Hank.
HANK
I look at you, and I feel a little tug at the edge of my
lips, right next to the kissing part. And before I know it,
I'm grinning again.
NORMA
(trying not to be charmed)
No sale; you're thirty minutes late.
HANK
Okay, you found me out.
Hank produces a poloroid, holds it up for Norma to examine.
HANK
A 1965 GTO. Convertible. One owner. Forty thousand
miles. Clean and cherry.
NORMA
For what?
HANK
For you. It's a surprise, honey. Well, it was.
NORMA
Where will we get the money? The diner's barely
breaking even.
HANK
I put a little money away for something special. Trust
me, okay?
NORMA
(lightly)
Trust you?
Hank pulls Norma a little closer, brings his hips as close as propriety allows. Norma
reacts, but she doesn't move away. Hank nearly whispers.
HANK
It's the car you always wanted, Norma. The car I said
I'd get you one day. Remember?
(beat)

HANK 
Tell me you remember, Norma.
Norma looks him right in the eyes, gently, but determined to resist him just the same.

Incredible.
LELAND
What did I tell you? Just another routine miracle of
everyday life here in Twin Peaks.
MADDY
Uncle Leland, you're doing all the right things.
LELAND
What do you mean, dear?
MADDY
When Dad died two years ago, I thought I'd never get
over it. Mom never has. It was focusing on the little
things that got me through it. The "everyday miracles."
LELAND
Life is a miracle. Maddy, I want to say something to
you, you don't have to answer, in fact you shouldn't. You
should think about it first. Promise first.
MADDY
Okay.
LELAND
You've said you don't really have that much to go back to
in Missoula. You've also said how much you like it here.




 
MADDY
It's true.
LELAND
What I want to say is: you don't have to go back. You can
stay with Sarah and me if you like, get your own place, of
course, but stay in town. We're family, too. We can
make a family here.
MADDY
(touched)
I don't know what to say.
LELAND
You shouldn't say anything until you eat that malted.
She smiles. They dig in.

LOG LADY
You wear bright objects on your chest.
MAJOR BRIGGS
(unfazed)
Yes. I do.
LOG LADY
Are you proud?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Achievement is its own reward. Pride obscures it.

The Log Lady nods. Major Briggs adds cream to her coffee. She sips.
LOG LADY
My log has something to tell you. Do you know him?
MAJOR BRIGGS
I don't believe we've been introduced.

Listen to me, Lucy Moran. You just listen.

When the Tacoma Sperm Bank was looking for donors,
naturally I applied. But a routine physical revealed that I

Hello, Hank.
Hank turns to find Sheriff Truman and Agent Cooper enter the office.
TRUMAN
I'm betting Lucy asked you to wait outside.
HANK
Might've. You know me, Harry. I'm an impulsive guy.
Truman sighs, circles to his desk. Retrieves the appropriate form.
TRUMAN
I know enough not to waste my time on small talk. So
why don't you sign in like a good boy, and keep your nose
clean for another week.
Hank stares at Harry for a long beat. There is bad blood between them. Then he signs
without a word, turns on his heels, and steps out the door. A beat, then:
COOPER
How long were you and Hank friends?
TRUMAN
We grew up together. Ed, Hawk, Hank, myself.
Bookhouse Boys. Back then Hank was the best of us.
But he had a way of setting his heart on something, then
taking it. No matter how much it cost him. One day he
set his heart on Norma. And he took her from Big Ed.
"Never cheat a pal." That was our code. Hank broke it.
An intercom beeper interrupts. Lucy's VOICE is heard:
LUCY'S VOICE
Sheriff Truman? I have Ben Home on the phone for you.
The line with the light that's blinking.

SHELLY JOHNSON stands with DOC HAYWARD at his bedside. She is dressed in
hospital garb. Shelly peers at Leo with fear, muted revulsion. His death was something to
be wished for. But this intermediate state is beyond Shelly's ability to understand.
HAYWARD
The bullet lodged in Leo's spine. We removed it
successfully. As for possible paralysis, it's too early to
tell. Leo lost so much blood, most of it before we had a
chance to' operate...
(beat)
I'm afraid tile resulting oxygen deprivation starved his
brain, induced the coma you see here.
SHELLY
He's a vegetable?




 
HAYWARD
(with a sigh)
He is not in pain. Beyond that, it's hard to tell.
SHELLY
Can you make him better?
Shelly's tone suggests she's not exactly pining for cure.
HAYWARD
We can maintain his current state. Offer him
nourishment, life support. But beyond that, our only ally
is time. I'm sorry, Shelly.
SHELLY
Me too. Arc they going to put him in prison?
HAYWARD
I know he's suspected of several felonies. But he can't be
charged with a crime until he's conscious or ruled
competent to stand trial.
SHELLY
I guess, at the moment, he's kind of in prison anyway.
HAYWARD
Yes he is.
She starts to cry, softly. Doc puts a comforting arm around her.

Jerry starts to dial internationally. Ben picks up an extension. Just then: a cheery shout at the
door.
LELAND'S VOICE
Gentlemen!!
Ben looks up. Now what? Leland hops into the office, all smiles and manic energy.
LELAND
I've been giving this a lot of thought. The mill fire will
no doubt put contract signing on hold for the moment, so
we must insure that the moment, our moment, does not
pass. I would recommend a quick and cordialfollow-up
phonecall to Iceland, a little gentle handling, just to let
Einer know we're on top of it.




 
JERRY
(deadpan)
We can handle that.
Just then: the call comes through.
BEN
Ben Home for Einer Thorson - Einer! (Icelandic phrase)
What's that? You heard about it how? Mr. Palmer called
you to tell you about the fire?
Leland gives a big "ok" sign to Ben. Jerry rolls his eyes.
BEN 
No, I wouldn't call it a disaster at all. It was just one of
those things. An unfortunate development but I assure you
it in no way affects our developmcnt plans.
JERRY
Jerry Horne here, Einer. All systems go. Full speed
ahead.
BEN
Of course, Einer. We will fax you all the pertinent
details. Yes, Einer, immediately. Don't you worry your
attractive little blond head about it, listen, in a meeting,
gotta run.
Ben puts down the receiver.

Excuse me?

Battis hears the door open, chirps:
BATTIS
Frosty? My little Snowman?
Audrey enters, sets the bucket at his feet. Battis, blindfolded, grins.
BATTIS
I feel a cold front moving in.
Audrey slips behind him, places her hands over the blindfold. Then slowly unties the knot
behind his head.
BATTIS
Mmmm. Better. Visible sin.
Audrey lets the loosened scarf slip down about his chin. Then, before he can react - she pulls
it tightly about his neck.
BATTIS
Hey!
AUDREY
Hiya, Mr. Battis. Remember me?
The voice, a glimpse of her face, tell Battis all he needs to know. He nods.
AUDREY
I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story. Are you listening?
With that she tugs the scarf a little tighter.
BATTIS
Yes. Yes.
AUDREY
Once upon a time there was this innocent little girl
named Red. That's me. And she met a horrible wolf.
That's you. And the wolf took her to a secret place and
did terrible things to her against her will. But the little
girl was tougher than she looked. She kicked the crap out
of the bad old wolf, and told her father all about it.
After that she told the police. And the bad old wolf
went to prison for a thousand years.




 
As she speaks, Audrey twists the scarf tighter and tighter. Now she releases it. Battis gasps
for breath. At last:
BATTIS
What do you want?
AUDREY
I want to know everything you know. The perfume
counter. Laura Palmer. Ronette Pulaski. And One-Eyed
Jack's.
BATTIS
You're insane.
AUDREY
I'm Audrey Horne. And I get what I want. Understand?
Audrey moves as if to tighten the scarf again. Battis protests.
BATTIS
Yes. All right.
A long beat. Battis sighs. And begins:
BATTIS
I work for the owner of One-Eyed Jack's.
Audrey pulls on the scarf. Whenever Battis hesitates, is tempted to lie, she reins him in.
AUDREY

Who is?
BATTIS
Your father. He owns it all. Hell, he owns everything.

I run girls through the perfume counter. I recruited
Ronnette and Laura.

One weekend. She was using drugs, we threw her out. I
never saw her again. I swear.

Maddy smiles, sways to the music. Then, slowly, she begins to dance. It's a sweet sudden

A trilling musical scale is HEARD from above.
CAMERA REVEALS Cooper on his bed, shoes off, holding his handmade wooden flute.
He pauses to glance at the television glowing in a corner. Then en activates the microrecorder positioned on a bedside table.





 
COOPER
Diane, I received bad news today. Windom Earle has
vanished. Audrey Home is missing. There is of course no
connection, except for the simple fact that my former
partner's disappearance seems to matter less to me than
that of a troublesome high school girl.
(beat)
Mr. Home is convinced she has run away and will return.
I wish I shared his confidence. Though not his callous
indifference.
(beat)
An all-points bulletin, routine checks of the train car and
Jacques' cabin have revealed nothing. Not a trace of her.
Cooper shuts off the recorder. As if to wonder. Then he starts it again. Speaks more softly:
COOPER
Audrey's absence touches me in ways I did not predict. I
find myself thinking not of clues or evidence, but of the
content of her smile. The way it gives the lie to her
delinquent posing, the hardened exterior which I suspect
is more a matter of self-preservation than a heart that is
cold. Audrey's heart is warm.
Cooper flicks off the recorder. Sets it on his bedside table. just then: a knock at the door.
COOPER
Just a minute.

Cooper rises with a wince - his wounds still give pain - and steps to the door. The last
time he opened it, Cooper received three slugs in the chest. This time he finds Major Briggs
standing there.
COOPER

BRIGGS
May I come in?
COOPER
Please.
Briggs enters, Cooper gestures toward the room's single chair. Briggs sits.
BRIGGS
I have a message for you.
COOPER
From whom?
BRIGGS
I am not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work. This
secrecy pains me from time to time. Any bureaucracy
that functions in secret inevitably lends itself to
corruption. But these are the rules I have pledged to
uphold. I believe a pledge is sacred.
COOPER
Speaking as both a man and a fellow employee of the
federal government so do I.
BRIGGS
I may reveal this much. Among my many tasks is the
maintenance of deep space monitors aimed at galaxies
beyond our own. We routinely receive various
communications, space garbage to decode and examine.
The results look something like this.
Briggs produces a paper readout, holds it out for Cooper to examine. The sheet is covered

Briggs holds out another paper readout, the usual jumbled numbers and letters. And a
message at its center: THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM. Cooper examines
the message, wonders:
COOPER
Why did you bring this to me?
Briggs holds out one last readout.

screaming RONETTE is being restrained by two NURSES, as DALE COOPER and
ALBERT ROSENFIELD arrive in the doorway.

Ronette got out of bed a while ago, pulled out her IV Cooper moves to her. Albert examines the IV bag. The contents are tinted blue.
ALBERT
Looks like dye.
Cooper takes out a pair of tweezers.
COOPER
Hold her down, Harry. Albert, get your microscope.
Albert opens his case, takes out a FIELD MICROSCOPE. Cooper takes out a pair of

It was our man. The letters were never made public.

Fellas ... let's stand together for a moment ... it's time I
mentioned something to you I'm not sure ...
but I believe I was visited by a Giant.
(they look at him)
In my room. Twice. He gave me three clues; the first
had to do with Jacques in his body bag and came true
almost immediately. The second was "the owls are not
what they seem," and the third was about a man who
points without chemicals.
They look at him.

No thanks.
Smith sits. She sits across from him.

Don't be nervous, Donna.

I'm not nervous. I'm curious.

Curious about my relationship with Laura.

Why did you send me that letter?

DONNA
Okay.
SMITH
I don't like to go outside. I ... can't. Do you have a
judgement about that you'd like to express?
DONNA
No.
Donna notices a piece of paper sticking out from under what appears to be the solid edge of a
bookshelf
SMITH
Laura said you were very fair-minded.
DONNA
If you knew her so well, why didn't she ever mention you
to me?
SMITH
She liked to think of me ... as a mystery in her life.
DONNA
Then why did you call me?
SMITH
I am ... I used to be a horticulturist. I raise orchids.
That's why it's so warm. in here. Laura always admired
them. I wrote you because I wanted to know if you'd be
kind enough to place one of them on her grave.
DONNA
Of course.
SMITH
Excuse me just a moment.
He goes into an adjoining room. The door is heavy, with a substantial lock. Donna rises
quickly, goes to the bookshelf, tugs on the piece of paper. It won't budge. She notices a gap
between the shelf and the wall, moves closer to take a look, then turns abruptly as the heavy
door opens behind her and Smith re-enters, carrying, a beautiful orchid plant. He conceals
any concern about her movements.

COOPER
R-B-T: I believe these letters and the giant's clues are in
some way connected to the long haired man.
(writes the names in a circle around the poster.)
Mrs. Palmer saw him in a vision. She called this
morning to say Laura's cousin, Maddy Ferguson, has seen
the man twice in the last three days, also in a vision. I
saw him in my dream.
TRUMAN
And Ronnette COOPER
- saw him physically in the train car. Four of us have
seen this man in different forms.
(draws a line from one name to another)
The path is a psychic link that will lead us to this man.
TRUMAN
So what did the giant sound like? Kind of a big
booming voice?
COOPER
No. He spoke very softly, directly and distinctly.
ALBERT
And you gave him the beans you were supposed to use to
buy a cow.

No, I gave him my ring.

Albert takes out THREE SMALL PACKETS OF COCAINE.

The cocaine you found in James Hurley's gas tank is a

Johnson's house. Get the picture?
COOPER
I've even got the frame.
ALBERT
The handywork of Leo Johnson, currently appearing at
Calhoun Memorial Hospital as Mr. Potato Head.
(retrieves a FLESHWORLD from his case)
The boots are a CircleBrand rare work boot. The ones
we found haven't been worn or tampered with. The
letter "B" from Ronette's finger was cut from a copy of
Fleshworld. A perfect match. This edition features a
swingers club for double amputees. No comment.
Albert points to the poster of the long-haired man.
ALBERT
We sent the portrait of our long haired man to every
agency from NASA to DEA and came up empty. This
cat is in nobody's data base.
COOPER
A man four of us have seen here in Twin Peaks.
ALBERT
(takes out three crushed bullets)
By the way, you were shot with a Walther PPK. James
Bond's gun.

The trail of who shot you is cold, Coop, but I hoovered
some fibers from the corridor outside your room. My
ticket out of Trolleyville. I'm headed back to the lab.
Albert snaps his briefcase closed.

He moves to leave, but Truman blocks his path.
TRUMAN
Albert, you make fun of everyone and everything and
then act like you deserve an award for it. That's just not
right. Get out of here before I do something I won't
regret. Again.
ALBERT
(smiles)
While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact of the
matter is I'm merely a naysayer and hatchet man in the
fight against violence. I pride myself in taking a punch
and would gladly take another because I choose to live
my life in the company of Ghandi and King. My
concerns are global. I reject absolutely revenge,
aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a
method is love. I love you, Sheriff Truman.

Go home, James.
James nods and slowly exits. Cooper moves off.

LUCY
75 words, wait a minute, 76 words ... 77. Oh, oh, that's 78.

Agent Cooper has asked me to find as many words as I
can that contain the letters B, T, and R.
HAWK

You knew him there.

Yes. Now, I know he wasn't a Chalbert. They were our

lot, then there was a white house. That's where he lived.

Mr. Cooper, as I told you, Audrey's gone missing
before on a semi-regular basis COOPER
Mr. Horne, let's speak frankly. Is there trouble at home?
BEN
Do I detect a note of something outside the scope of
professional concern?
COOPER
Audrey and I have struck up an acquaintance.
BEN
Acquaintance. Cooper, here's the best advice you're
going to get all week. Men fall under the spell of
Audrey's charms like ducks in a shooting gallery. It's
not pretty. If you don't want a load of buckshot in your
tailfeathers, park your jalopy outside somebody else's
window.
COOPER
(a slight retreat)
If I've overstepped my bounds, I apologize. I assure
you I'm here with nothing but the best intentions.
BEN
That much is achingly clear and not unappreciated. I'll
leave a lamp in the window and you're my first call
when she comes home to roost.
COOPER
Thank you.
BEN
No, thank you.

Tremayne wolfes down his meatloaf. Lucy nibbles.
TREMAYNE
- of course, most of the time I keep my department
running like a top, but last Christmas was such a
madhouse, absolutely no time for paper work, I had to
literally invent a system for memorizing customer
orders using mnemonic triggers. For instance you've got
someone looking for argyle socks; that would be file"s"
for sock, subheading "a" for argyle. Now it gets tricky;
a request for a vulcanized macintosh , for instance, is it
heading "r" for raingear or "w" for waterproof? My
familiarity with inventory has me leaning towards "r" -








 

Richard happily digs into his meatloaf.
TREMAYNE
Lucy, may I ask you something? Do you find it odd
that I don't switch my fork when I eat, that I bring it to
my mouth with my left hand?

My mother called it "piling."
TREMAYNE
Actually, it's not odd at all, it's the European way.
He demonstrates and smiles. Pause.

end up on a display bed in Horne's home furnishings. I

Let me do this for you. Open wide.
Jean places the candy on Audrey's tongue. He slowly swirls it around the inside of her
mouth.
JEAN 
English caramels. Sugar's what you need.
Audrey sucks hungrily on his finger. He pulls the candy out of her mouth.
AUDREY
Please ...
Jean gently strokes her cheek.
JEAN
Go slow, baby. Candy's dandy. Plenty more where that
came from. My name's Jean.
Nancy lifts the cover from the tray. Jean puts the candy back in her mouth, takes a syringe
off the tray.
JEAN
Sweet sleep. Feel the warmth.
He injects her off-camera. She moans, then starts to nod off. Jean and Nancy exchange a
lascivious look.

 INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - DAY
Blackie and Battis watch a TAPE on one the security screens on her desk; Blackie points out
Cooper on the tape, in his tux, gambling at One Eyed Jack's.
BLACKIE
That's the man.
BATTIS
Oh my God ...
BLACKIE
You know him?
BATTIS
FBI, he's FBI, I saw him at the town meeting after Laura
died, he was up here?
JEAN'S VOICE
I want him.
Jean and Nancy are standing behind them. Blackie stops the tape freezing it on Cooper.
BLACKIE
Jean Renault, Emory. Say something weak and fawning.
BATTIS
Jacques was your b-brother.
BLACKIE
And this is my sister. Nancy.
JEAN
I also had a brother named Bernard. This business cost
me them both.
BLACKIE
I told you we were going to have help.
Jean grabs Battis by the chin.
JEAN
I'm your go-between. The father pays me, my cut is
thirty percent. He never knows who snatched his baby.
And I get the man who took care of my brother. What's
his name?
He presses Battis' nose up against the screen next to Cooper's image.
BATTIS
Cooper.


JEAN
And all you have to do is give him to me.
BATTIS
M-mr. Horne can do that maybe.
NANCY
(pats Battis on the head)
You're going to be a big help, aren't you?
BATTIS
Whatever you want, want me to do.
JEAN
A tape of the girl. Get it now.
BATTIS
Yes, all right.
(Jean shoves Battis towards the door, dismisses
him)
I'd - I'd like to keep my job, at the store. That's
important to me.
JEAN
Go away.
Battis leaves. Blackie and her sister square off. Clearly they hate each other.
BLACKIE
What the hell do you bring her here for?
JEAN
She's with me.
BLACKIE
I can see she's with you.
JEAN
No: she's with me.
BLACKIE
She goes back north or this deal goes south.
NANCY
Jean, tell my sister to behave herself or you'll get mad.
JEAN
She stays. You get the cash. I get Cooper. Everybody's
happy. Of course, we can't let the girl live now, can we?

 INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY -
Truman talks on the phone looking out the window.
TRUMAN
Thanks, Pete. I appreciate the call.
He hangs up. Then looks up to see Cooper in the door way.
TRUMAN 
Josie called Pete. She'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
COOPER
Let's get her down here.
TRUMAN
Coop, I'd like a favor. I'd like to see her first. Alone.
COOPER
(uncomfortably stern)
Harry, we can't let personal feelings interfere with our
work.
TRUMAN
Sometimes that's easier said than done.
Pause.






COOPER
Talk to her. Bring her in.
TRUMAN
She may not be involved with any of it.
COOPER
I said you could talk to her.
Hawk's knock on the doorframe breaks the tension.
HAWK
(from a notebook)
Pearl Lakes; there is a vacant lot next to the Palmer
house, and next to that is a white house that's boarded up.
No name on the mailbox.
COOPER
Run a title check.
HAWK
County's working on it, plus Power and Light's
searching their records.
COOPER
When will we hear?
HAWK
Morning, earliest.
TRUMAN
You haven't seen Gerard the shoe salesman, have you?
COOPER
The one-armed man?
TRUMAN
He came in to show me some samples. He got faint and
went to the bathroom. I came back from lunch his
sample case was gone.
COOPER
The one-armed man was here?
TRUMAN
That's what I just said.

COOPER
In my dream, the one-armed man knew Bob.
TRUMAN
So?
Cooper quickly leaves the room. Truman and Hawk look at each other and follow.
CUT TO:
 INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Cooper bursts through the door, looks around, opens each of the stalls. Hawk and Truman
enter behind him.
TRUMAN
What's the problem?
Cooper gets down on his hands and knees. Sees something, on the floor in one of the stalls.
Takes out a handkerchief, reaches in and picks up the syringe Gerard dropped.
COOPER
We've got to find the one-armed man. It's the giant's
third clue. "Without chemicals, he points."

 EXT. JAMES HURLEY'S HOME - DAY
A housetrailer on a lonely lot with a couple of aluminum lean-to's off the house. The shades
on the window are drawn. James, wheels his Harley into one of the lean-to's. A late model
car pulls up with man driving. COLLEEN HURLEY gets out of the passenger side. She is
fortyish and gave James his good looks. Her's are on their way out.
JAMES
Mom,
Colleen walks towards her son unsteadily.
COLLEEN
There he is, the fair haired boy. Where have you been,
My fair haired boy?
JAMES
I was at school. It's a school day.

 
COLLEEN
God bless the public indoctrination system. Keeps the
kids off the streets, keeps the streets safe for the street
sweepers. In San Francisco, the street sweepers have an
epic quality JAMES
Ma ... Ma, you've been gone for a week.
COLLEEN
Kiddo, when the muse calls out, we're helpless to resist.
A poem she said, four days worth. Yes, I replied.
JAMES
Are you okay?
COLLEEN
Myself, I've been better. The poem's pretty good.
She takes out a paper with her poem on it.
COLLEEN
I learned early on. Write it down, escape the humdrum
that life has dealt you. Play with marked cards.
(puts on glasses and reads)
"Poet Lariat/Rope, rope/Bulldogged down, rodeo town/
The last of the Sabine Women---"
JAMES
I don't want to hear this.
COLLEEN
"... Sun 'goes down, rodeo town/Lariat ropes a-"
JAMES
Stop.
COLLEEN
Jimmy, are we being rude?
James pours the rest of her vodka bottle onto the ground.
COLLEEN
Fine, if it makes you feel better.
JAMES
You don't know anything.
COLLEEN
I know girl trouble when I see it. Some little logtown

COLLEEN 
siren's cut you up. I recognize the wound patterns.
JAMES
You sure can spot it, Ma.
COLLEEN
Am I right?
JAMES
Her name was Laura.
COLLEEN
Lash yourself to the mast, Odysseus. Eat the Lotus.
Forger her. Sail on. The danger for you, my darling boy,
is you'll never know whether she's an angel or a harpie sent
from hell to rend your heart, and believe me, she'll be
one or the other.
JAMES
She was both.
COLLEEN
Ah, but that's the secret, Jimmy boy, They all are.
CUT TO:
 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Under DOC HAYWARD'S supervision a MALE ORDERLY and another MAN wearing a
shirt that reads "Twin Peaks Security Co." finish putting metal restraints around NADINE
HURLEY'S wrists, as ED HURLEY stands by.
ED
Is this really necessary?
HAYWARD
It's for her own protection Ed. She ripped two pair of
leather restraints last night like they were tissue paper.
ED
How is that possible?
HAYWARD
I ran a blood test; she's pumping out adrenaline like a
wildcat well, never seen anything like it.








 
HAYWARD 
You being here might calm her down. Talk to her.
Maybe sing. Does she have a favorite song?
ED
Does she have a favorite song?
HAYWARD
Short of a trip to Lourdes.
ED
Okay, Doc. But if I'm going to sing to her I'd rather it
was just the two of us.
The restraints are in place, the others leave.
DOC
I'll close the door behind me.
Doc pats Ed on the shoulder and exits.
ED
Nadine, Doc says I should sing a song to you. I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what you'd like to hear.
He takes a long look at her, starts to hum, then sing "On Top of Old Smokey." During the
chorus, Nadine begins to squeeze his hand. Hard. Ed tries to pull away with no luck. He
bravely continues to sing.
Nadine is now practically breaking his hand. Ed keeps singing thru the pain.









 (2)
Nadine lets go of his hand and snaps the metal meshes that hold her hands. They explode off
her wrists. Ed staggers back. Nadine's hands begin to clap in rhythm.
ED
Good God ...
NADINE

I'm a jack and you're a jack/Steeple jacks are we...
I'm a jack and you're a jack/Steeple jacks are we

Nadine repeats the cheer. When she finishes she is clear and beaming at Ed.
NADINE
Hi, Eddie, did you come by to pick me up?
ED
Huh?
NADINE
Doc Hayward says tonsillitis or no tonsillitis I can go to
cheerleader tryouts.
ED
Cheerleader tryouts.

 INT. JACOBY'S HOSPITAL ROOM
Truman and Cooper enter. A beautiful young HAWAIIAN WOMAN kneels beside DR.
JACOBY. Cooper and Truman watch her for a moment. She nods to Truman and Cooper.
TRUMAN
Dr. Jacoby ...
JACOBY
Gents, this is my wife, Eolani. She lives at our place in
Hanalei. We're practising Kahuna healing.
COOPER
How do you do?
TRUMAN
M'am.
She nods graciously. A beat. Eolani begins to light candles around Jacoby's bed.
COOPER
Are you ready to be hypnotized?
JACOBY
I've been under many times. Here, read this, it's the
auto-suggestion program I use.
(hands Cooper a typed sheet; in Hawaiian)
Eolani, start the tape please.
Mrs. Jacoby hits a tape recorder that plays a tape of waves on the shore. Jacoby hands a
green volcanic stone with a hole in the middle of it to Truman.
JACOBY
Sheriff, could you hold that just beyond the bed.
He relaxes, focusing on the stone that Truman is holding








 
JACOBY 
Okay, Agent Cooper. I'm ready.
COOPER
(reading)
You are standing on a smooth green carpet of grass. Your
ball is fifteen feet from hole. Beyond the green, two
pristine white sandtraps and a lily filled pond yawn out
towards the emerald fairway. A warm whisper of a
breeze moves the flowers on the water ever so slightly.
Jacoby's eyes slowly close.
COOPER 
The hole seems to slowly drift away across the green
towards the pond, carried by the summer wind. The
green grows larger and larger ... the green engulfs you,
enveloping you in a soft blanket of peace ... you stroke
the ball, it drifts towards the hole and gently drops in
its center ...
Jacoby is under.
COOPER
Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?
JACOBY
Yes.
COOPER
Raise your right arm.
Jacoby does.
COOPER
We're going to the night you came to the hospital.
JACOBY
Yes.
COOPER
You are in your hospital room. You are in your room
with Jacques Renault.
JACOBY
Right.
COOPER
Do you smell anything? Burned engine oil?







 (2)
JACOBY
No. I smell engine oil in the park.
COOPER
In the park where you were attacked.
JACOBY
Just before. It fills the air. Then someone hits me from
behind.
COOPER
You don't see who it is.
JACOBY
No.
COOPER
Let's go to the hospital now. You're lying in bed. Does
anyone come into the room?
JACOBY
Nurses, Doc Hayward, you, Sheriff Truman.
COOPER
What happens after we leave?
JACOBY
I dream I'm at Hanauma Bay. Juggling coconuts at a
Luau. The guests are all Nigerians.
COOPER
Did anyone else come into the room?
JACOBY
Yes.
COOPER
Can you tell me about it?
JACOBY
The sound of tape ripping wakes me up. I see tape going
around Jacques wrists. Now there's a pillow on his
face. He's making a noise that almost sounds like
barking. A bell is ringing. It won't stop. Jacques stops
moving. I look up to see who's holding the pillow.
Pause.

COOPER
Who is it? Do you see who it is?
JACOBY
(surprise)
I know him.

 EXT. THE CEMETERY - NIGHT
Open on LAURA PALMER'S GRAVE. Behind it, Donna approaches slowly until she arrives
in front of the gravestone. She sets down Harold Smith's orchid.
DONNA
This is from Harold Smith.
(deep breathe)
Sorry I haven't been out since the funeral. Things are
pretty strange. So, anyway, were you sleeping with this
guy Harold or what?
(pause)
He seems pretty nice. Kind of an oddball. I guess
anybody can start to seem that way when you look close
enough.
(pause)
We have to talk. Maybe you already know about me and
James, but anyway after you died we kind of got
together. This is not something I feel like I'd have to
explain to you because you probably knew how we felt
before we did. How could you be so smart about stuff
like that and so stupid about so much else?
(pause, quiets emotions, then ...)
I'm mad at you; when it was you and me and James it
kind of worked. Now you're one, I love James and
it's a mess. Your cousin Maddy's here and something's
going on with them maybe and I think I'm going to end
up losing both of you.
(pause)
I wanted so much to be like you. To have your strength
and your courage, but look what it did, look what it
did to you, Laura
(after a beat)
As much as I loved you, Laura, most of the time we
were trying to solve your problems, and you know what,
we still are. Not James' or mine, or Maddy's, yours.
You're dead, but your problems are still hanging around.
It's like they didn't bury you deep enough.
(realization, strong)
I can't help you anymore. I love you but I can't. It's
not fair. Okay? Deal?
She listens. Quietly.







 
DONNA 
I love you but it's not fair.
She walks slowly away. Close on the orchid, stirred by a breeze.
CUT TO:
 INT. PALMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Maddy sits in the living room folding laundry. Maddy looks up and sees James standing in
the door way. Looking for help.
MADDY
James?
JAMES
I've been trying to find Donna. I looked everywhere. I
have to talk to somebody.
MADDY
What's wrong, James?
JAMES
She came back. She was loaded. She didn't know
anything. God I hate her.
MADDY
Who, James?
James is pulling himself apart. He tries to talk but nothing comes out. She holds him.
MADDY
God, you're on fire.
James pulls back a little. Their faces are close. They kiss. Gently at first and then with
passion. Maddy pulls away quickly.
JAMES
Hold me.
She does. Hugging with tenderness. We hear faint sound of voices off









 
Donna enters, sees Maddy and James pulling apart from their embrace.
MADDY
Donna?
DONNA
Oh God ...
Donna runs out of the room. James slowly stands, going crazy. With a cry, he sweeps an end
table clean of pictures, curios and a lamp. James pushes his way past a stunned Leland.
JAMES
DONNA!
CUT TO:
 EXT. STREET - NIGHT
James runs down the street after her car as it pulls away.
JAMES
Donna! Donna!
He stops, kneels in the street, puts his hands over his eyes and cries out. He angrily wipes
away his tears.
CUT TO:
 INT. PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
Leland listens to a bewildered Maddy.
MADDY
All I did was come to a funeral. It's like I fell into a
dream. It's like people think I'm Laura. I not I'm
nothing like her.
LELAND
It's so hard
She folds into his arms.
LELAND 
I know, I know.








 
MADDY
All I know is Laura was my cousin and I loved her and
she died and I don't know anything else.
LELAND
You want life to be the way it was before ...
MADDY
Yes.
LELAND
So do I, dear. We all do. And try as we might, it just
won't cooperate, will it?
(she shakes her head)
If life could only be like those summers up at Pearl
Lakes. Simple and sweet. If life could only be like that
all the time ...
Leland looks up. Truman and Cooper have quietly entered the room.
TRUMAN
Leland? The door was open.
LELAND
What is it?
TRUMAN
Leland, we ...
(he can't do it, looks at Cooper, who nods)
You're under arrest for the murder of Jacques Renault.
Pause.

 INT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Smith answers a frantic knocking to find a tearful Donna outside.
DONNA
I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go.
SMITH
Donna, what's wrong?
DONNA
God, I don't even know if I want to talk about it, I feel
so stupid.
SMITH
Sit down. Slow down.







 
DONNA
I keep telling myself that James is confused, but how
long am I supposed to tell myself that?
HAROLD
James Hurley?
DONNA
Yes. Just when I thought I had it all figured out. Why
do I even care? Why should I care?
HAROLD
You care because you care for him. Don't you?
DONNA
I wish I didn't. I just want it to stop.
SMITH
First, you have to stop.
(he studies her benignly)
What was it she always used to say to you? "Donna
Madonna, there's always manana."
DONNA
How'd you know that?
SMITH
(an enigmatic smile)
I'll get you something to drink.
Smith moves to the other room [to get some whine. Donna sits up.] On the writing table by
the window Donna notices [is] another orchid. She walks over to admire it. Next to the plant
is an open book [and a second book in which Smith has been writing].
INTERCUT:

Leland, you have the right to an attorney.
(beat)
Leland ... ?
LELAND
(with a wave of the hand)
No, no. I waive that right. I'm a lawyer ...
VOICE
I'm going to ask you some questions. Anything you say
may be held against you in a court of law. Do you
understand?
LELAND
Yes. Of course.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
(after a beat)
On Friday morning, March third, did you go to
Calhoun Memorial Hospital?
Leland answers quietly, intent, as if commenting on the actions of someone else.
LELAND
Yes
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Why did you go there?
LELAND
I was looking for someone.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Who were you looking for?
LELAND
The man who killed my daughter.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Did you know his name?








LELAND
No. Yes. I do now. Jacques Renault.
TRUMAN
What made you think he killed Laura?
LELAND
(steadfast)
You arrested him.
TRUMAN
Leland ... did you kill Jacques Renault?
LELAND
(his eyes shine with unshed tears)
He killed my Laura. The things he did to her... have
you ever experienced ... absolute loss?
COOPER
(gently)
I doubt any of us is a stranger to grief.
LELAND
(looking into his heart)
It's more than grief. So deep inside you, every cell
screams. You hear nothing else.
(beat)
Yes I killed him. Yes, Yes, Yes ...
Leland Palmer breaks down and cries. Truman, Cooper, and DOC HAYWARD arrayed
about the weeping man. HOLD ON this tableau for a beat.
CUT TO:



INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
Cooper and Doc Hayward exit interrogation and walk down a station hallway.
COOPER
He'll plead temporary insanity.
HAYWARD
We'll need a psychiatric exam. I can tell you this.
Parents should not bury their children. Anyone who's
suffered what Leland has ...
(shrugs, lets the implication linger)








COOPER
(gently)
Do you approve of murder, Doctor Hayward?
HAYWARD
No.
But in this case, his tone suggests, he's considered the exception.
CUT TO:



INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN fidgets in the reception area. Tries hard not to look like he's
waiting for someone. When Doc Hayward and Cooper enter, Andy nearly shouts.
BRENNAN
Hey Doc!
HAYWARD
How are you, Andy?
ANDY
Fine. Great. Fine.
Andy's smile is false. A beat.
HAYWARD
What the problem?
ANDY
(looking left and right)
It's sort of personal.
HAYWARD
I'm your doctor, Andy.
Andy hesitates. This is quite difficult for him. At last, almost in a whisper.
ANDY
It's about my sperms test.
HAYWARD
(prompting)
Yes ...?
ANDY
You know ... I flunked.








HAYWARD
That's not the precise term for it ...
ANDY
Well I was just wonderin' if it's the kind of test you can
take over, you know, like a driver's exam? I mean I've
been wearing boxer shorts every day like you told me HAYWARD
You'd like to give it another shot.
ANDY
Yes sir I would.
HAYWARD
Well then I'll need a sample to take with me.
Hayward sifts through his Gladstone, hands Andy a small sample jar. Andy pales.
ANDY
Right now?
HAYWARD
Put it in a brown paper bag. I'll wait in the car.
Doc exits. Andy glances wildly about the reception room. No one's looking. He spots the
box full of "FLESH WORLD" magazines.
CUT TO:



INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
Coming around a corner, Andy and LUCY MORAN nearly collide. She's lugging a
coffeemaker. He's toting a couple of FLESH WORLDS, which he promptly drops. Lucy
spots the pornography, then peers over Andy's shoulder, his destination beyond. The MEN'S
ROOM. Lucy shakes her head sadly and storms off Andy watches her vanish with a wince.
CUT TO:



INT. RECEPTION - DAY
Truman and Cooper sit in reception with coffee, taking a breather. Cooper cases himself into
a chair with a grimace, as Truman runs down the day's business.









TRUMAN
Our judge is scheduled to arrive this afternoon. Clinton
Sternwood. Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.
COOPER
Outdoors enthusiast?
TRUMAN
Last of the frontiersmen. They broke the mold.
COOPER
Bail hearing for Leland. Leo's competency examination.
TRUMAN
That's the agenda. Does Leland get bail?
COOPER
That's up to your state prosecutor.
TRUMAN
Daryl Lodwick. Also on his way.
COOPER
What do we hear from Hawk?
TRUMAN
(off notes)
Called this morning. County says nobody by the name
of 'Robertson' ever lived next to the Palmers. Got a
forwarding address on the last occupants; Kalispell.
He'll check it by afternoon.
(a little disappointed by the paucity of leads)
That's it.
Cooper sips his coffee.
CUT TO:

5A. INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Andy exits the bathroom, holding a small paper bag. He hurries around the corner, bumps
into a coatrack and drops the bag. The bag opens and the sample rolls away down the hall,
coming to rest under a chair in reception. Andy hurries after it, diving past Cooper and
Truman to retrieve it. Cooper sees the bottom of Andy's new boots.
COOPER
Andy, don't move (Andy freezes, his hand on the sample)
Andy, where did you get those?






5A. 
ANDY
(frightened)
Don't make me say where they came from.
COOPER
Andy ANDY
Please, Agent Cooper, this is extremely personal
business.
COOPER
Your shoes.
ANDY
Oh. I'm sorry. Phillip Gerard sold 'em to me
yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.
COOPER
(pointing out the sole to Truman)
These are the same brand of shoe we found at Leo
Johnson's. The giant said There was a clue out there.
TRUMAN
I thought it was cocaine.

CLERK
Mr. Horne?








BEN
Walk with me and talk.
CLERK
Okay, so this friend of mine works for the Seattle Post
Dispatch, actually my sister went to college with her,
but she's kind of a friend of mine too. Anyway she
called me this morning with a hot tip. Top secret.
M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
BEN
M.T. Wentz ... M.T. Wentz ...







CLERK
M.T. Wentz, the travel writer BEN
Yes. M.T. Wentz. The travel writer.
CLERK
Wentz travels incognito, using only cash. No credit
cards, no way to trace his identity. Or hers. No one at
the paper even knows who he or she is.
BEN
(figuring the benefit)
A favorable Wentz review can spell big business.
CLERK
(so excited)
He's coming, he's coming he's coming BEN
(interrupting)
Keep an eye on registration. I want hourly updates.
Scrutinize every check-in DESK CLERK
Especially if they pay cash.
HORNE

It's not even nine thirty and you've already done a good
day's work.
Ben turns on his heels, walks away without another word.
CUT TO:



INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ben enters his office, stops short. JEAN RENAULT sits on his desk, beside a portable
television set, complete with built-in video cassette player.
RENAULT
(quiet, nearly whispered)
Mr. Horne. You look well.
BEN
(taking a closer look)
What can I do for you?








RENAULT
We've met. I sell 'insurance' to small businesses. Like
One-Eyed Jack's.
The mention catches Ben's attention. He closes the door behind him. Steps closer.
BEN
Jean Renault. What's the occasion? Are my premiums
about to be raised?
Renault produces a video tape, inserts it into the television. Presses PLAY. Ben stops
suddenly, pales: Audrey appears on screen, drugged, incoherent. Her wrists visibly bound.
BEN 
You bastard.
RENAULT
Don't make a mistake, Mr. Horne. I'm just the
messenger.
BEN
For whom?
Renault shakes his index finger. He will dictate the terms of their discussion from this point
on. Renault FREEZE-FRAMES Audrey's image, continues:
RENAULT
There are terms. Would you like to hear them?
BEN
Yes.
RENAULT
They request a large sum of money BEN
How much?
RENAULT
I require something else, entirely.
BEN
They should bear the cost of their own middleman RENAULT
They can't give me what I want. Would you like to hear
what I want?







(2)
BEN
Yes.
RENAULT
Number one your business up there is run by pickpockets
and fools. Every dollar earned, there's a dollar stolen.
Are you aware of that?
BEN
(beat, doesn't want to appear disadvantaged)
I have my suspicions.
RENAULT
What you need is a partner. Who could take care of your
little problem.
BEN
I already have a partner.
RENAULT
Okay. Do you want my help or not?
BEN
Yes. Yes.
RENAULT
One more thing.
Renault presses FAST-FORWARD on his remote. He stops the tape at a familiar image:
Cooper in tuxedo, seated at one of the casino's blackjack tables. Ben reacts to Cooper's image
with surprise, trepidation. What's Cooper doing in his casino?
RENAULT 
I want this man to deliver the ransom.
BEN
Why? That man's a Federal agent.
RENAULT
Do you want your daughter back?
BEN
Of course, but I can't involve RENAULT
(counts on his fingers)
Cash. Partners. FBI man.

(he can't help himself)
That's supposed be an equitable exchange?
Jean smiles. He can't help but appreciate Ben's venality under pressure.
RENAULT
This could turn out well. I'll leave the video. It could
help clarify your thinking. Expect a call tomorrow.
Noon.
He exits. A long beat. And Ben steps to his desk, picks up the the phone, punches a button:
BEN
Janet, find Agent Cooper for me, please. It's urgent.

ACT TWO
FADE IN:


INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
HANK JENNINGS carries two covered Meals On Wheels trays from kitchen to counter.
DONNA HAYWARD waits to receive them.
HANK
You're looking real pretty today, Donna.
DONNA
(neutral)
Thanks.
HANK
(re trays)
Special occasion?
DONNA
Lunch with ... someone I met on my route.
HANK
(cheery)
Bed pans and shut-ins. Who's to meet?
DONNA
You wouldn't understand.
Donna reacts to the slight with muted anger. As if to defend the absent Harold Smith. She
grabs the trays, heads for the door. HANK eyes her figure as she exits. NORMA JENNINGS
hurries into view, interrupts his reverie:
NORMA
Hank, listen to this: Louie called from the Northern.
M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
HANK
Empty who?
NORMA
Only the most powerful restaurant critic in the state. A
good review in a Seattle paper could mean a lot of
business. He's going to try and send him our way.
HANK
(perking up)
What's he look like?








NORMA
Nobody knows. It's a secret I guess. But he thinks he's
arriving today.
HANK
(newly determined, takes off his kitchen apron)
Then we've still got time.
NORM
For what?
HANK
I'll pick up some flowers, maybe some candles and
tableclothes - now what could we put on the menu, some
specials maybe NORMA
I've always wanted to do some regional dishes HANK
Babe, we're gonna trick this joint out like Christmas in
July.
Hank grabs some cash from the register, gives Norma a kiss, steps toward the door. Norma
smiles, moved by his boyish enthusiasm. It's the man with whom she fell in love.
HANK
Oh, and I think you ought to give Big Ed a call.
NORMA
(not ready for this)
Why?
HANK
(seeming innocence)
You're still friendly, right? So maybe this Wentz fella
stops in for gas, suggest the Double R to any
new faces he sees.
NORMA
(careful)
I'll call him.




HANK
Good. You do that.
For just an instant, almost imperceptibly, a chill passes through Hank's voice. Norma and Big
Ed. Hank leavens the latter with a smile, turns and steps out the door.
CUT TO:
 INT. HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT DAY
HAROLD SMITH carefully sets Donna's trays atop a blanket before her. He's turned his
living room into an indoor picnic; silverware and plates, he's even produced a wicker basket.
Donna watches, impressed.
SMITH
(quiet charm)
How many agoraphobics do you know who own a picnic
basket?
DONNA
Not too many, I guess.
Smith sits across from her, cross-legged, with a smile.
SMITH
The food looks delicious. Thank you.
DONNA
I wanted it to be special.
SMITH
It is. Very. What am I thinking? We should have wine.
Smith leaps up, energized, he steps toward a door, opens it to reveal a wine rack inside.
SMITH
Any requests?
DONNA
(quietly admiring)
Don't ask me. All the boys I know drink beer.
SMITH
I'll select something appropriate. The Germans
practically invented picnic wine. Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
DONNA
Parlez vous Francais?




SMITH
Of course; you speak a Romance language.
Smith opens the wine with subtle ceremony, pours a little into a glass for Donna to sample.
She looks at him, wonders. He nods, prompts. Donna takes a little sip.
DONNA
Wow.
(more adult)
It's very good. Thanks.
Smith smiles, pours the rest. He holds up his glass.
SMITH
What shall we drink to?
DONNA
(after a beat)
To Laura.
SMITH
To Laura. In our hearts and memories.
They touch glasses. A spark passes between them. Smith reaches toward an end table, grasps
Laura's diary. The one Donna spotted there previously. Donna reacts. Smith looks at her; can
see the eager curiosity in her eyes.
SMITH 
Her diary. Did I tell you I had this?
DONNA
(masking)
Laura's diary?
SMITH
Would you like me to read? It seems appropriate.
DONNA
Please.
Smith turns through the diary, selects a page. He begins.
SMITH
"But still I'm afraid to tell her of my fantasies and my
nightmares; sometimes she's good at understanding,
other times she just giggles, and I don't have the nerve to
ask why things like that are funny to her."




 (2)
Donna reacts. She knows exactly to whom Laura is referring. Smith continues:
SMITH 
"So I feel badly again and shut up about it for a long
time. I love Donna very much, but sometimes I worry
that she wouldn't be around me at tall if she knew what
my insides were like. Black and dark, and soaked with
dreams of big, big men and different ways they might
hold me and take me into their control ..."
Smith reads the latter without emotion, an even odder twist to Laura's musing. Donna
reacts, saddened, embarrassed somehow. She wants Smith to stop and he can see it.
SMITH
Is something wrong?
DONNA
I'm just thinking, I mean, isn't that evidence? Shouldn't
we give it to Sheriff Truman?
SMITH
No.
(less intense)
I've read this from cover to cover, Donna. There are no
solutions here. Besides, she gave it it to me.
DONNA
Why?
SMITH
Safekeeping. Laura knew about my work.
DONNA
(working on him)
I don't know anything about it.
SMITH
(a small smile)
No. You don't.
(beat)
I'm a collector.
Smith rises, steps to a bookshelf.
DONNA
Of what?





 (3)
SMITH
Lives. People come to me and tell me their stories.
About the world outside. I take their stories and place
them in a ... larger context. A sort of living novel.
DONNA
Who tells you?
SMITH
Friends. Lovers
(beat)
Maybe you will too, someday
Donna shivers. With a quiet thrill, some anticipation. And just a sliver of fear.
CUT TO:
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Cooper and Horne look at the small television/VCR on the desktop.
BEN
You were right. Her kidnappers contacted me this
morning. Damn me, but you were right.
COOPER
(reaching for the phone)
I'll call the sheriff HORNE
(stopping him)
God no. They'll kill her at the first sign of police
involvement. That's why I called you.
COOPER
That's no reason to circumvent normal channels.
BEN
Normal channels won't bring my daughter back alive.







 
Ben turns to the small television, presses PLAY. Audrey's image appears on the screen.
Cooper stares at the screen with evident emotion. Ben's got him right where he wants him.
BEN 
(Softly)
You and Audrey have a special relationship. You of all
people understand her value to me. They want to make
the exchange tomorrow. Audrey for one hundred and
twenty-five thousands dollars. Cash. But I must ask you;
will you take it there.
HOLD ON Cooper for a beat. Starring at Audrey, helpless on the video screen.

 THE BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
START ON the kitchen door. Someone turns the knob, kicks it open. A figure steps inside,
face hidden by the absurd number of shopping bags, hatboxes, etc. that they are carrying.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals s JOSIE PACKARD behind the boxes and bags. She sets the
loot down or the kitchen table. PETE MARTEL enters, sees her.
PETE
Josie.
They enter into a warm embrace.
JOSIE
Oh, Pete. I'm so sorry.
PETE
Me too.
JOSIE
I keep thinking about Andrew. What he would have
done about the fire. Thank goodness Catherine was here
to handle everything.
Pete's face falls. She doesn't know. Josie sees it.
JOSIE
What is it?







 
PETE
(after a beat)
Josie, Catherine died in the fire.
JOSIE
Oh my God.
PETE
We're planning a service. They haven't found the body ...
Pete cannot continue. Josie pulls him back into their embrace. This time to heal. Or perhaps
to hide her own delight at Catherine's passing.
JOSIE
Oh, Pete.
PETE
(quietly)
In a couple days, we'll go ahead. I don't know exactly
what we'll bury.
(pulls back, embarrassed by emotions)
JOSIE
I feel so guilty. Shopping in Seattle. Everyone must
have been wondering PETE
Harry'd sure liked to hear from you, I know that.
JOSIE
Yes. I'll call him.
PETE
And you got a strange message on the phone yesterday.
Man talked real quiet. Wouldn't give his name.
JOSIE
(alert)
Did you write it down?
PETE
Didn't have to. It was so strange I remembered it. "In
1997 Hong Kong will be returned to the mainland."
What the heck do you suppose that was about?
JOSIE
(lying effectively)
I'm sure I don't know.
CUT TO:




 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
EMORY BATTIS roughly escorts Audrey into Blackie's office. Jean Renault sits at her desk.
Audrey tries to focus, look at the man before her. But she's weak, barely coherent.
BATTIS
C'mon, Dreamboat, daddy's waiting.
Emory shoves her down into a chair. Renault reacts with a frown.
BATTIS
Miss Home has been a very bad girl. Refusing to take
her medicine.
AUDREY
(faintly)
No more. Please.
Battis scoffs. But Renault surprises him.
RENAULT
Audrey, have you been mistreated?
Battis reacts. What the hell is this? Audrey pauses, then looks hard at Battis.
AUDREY
(the best she can manage)
He hit me.
BATTIS
I did not hit her. If that's what you're thinking. I didn't.
RENAULT
(only to Audrey)
That was wrong. It will never happen again. For as long
as you are with me. Do you understand?
(Audrey manages a nod)
I spoke to your father this morning. You're in no danger.
Everything's going to be fine. You do trust me, don't
you Audrey?
Renault's voice is hypnotically soothing. His concern seems genuine. Audrey feels safe
somehow. Battis steps back to Audrey, sits in a chair beside her. As if to rejoin the team.
BATTIS
You see, Audrey, in a situation like this, people have to
handle themselves in a professional manner. We're all
reasonable people. Something reasonable can be worked
out whenever reasonable people put their minds to it 




 
Renault casually pulls out a silenced .38 and shoots Battis three times. A beat. Battis, quite
dead, and his chair, fall over backwards. Audrey recoils in horror. Renault holds her.
RENAULT 
There, there. There, there.
HOLD ON Audrey for a beat. The nightmare begins again.

ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
DOC HAYWARD sits on the sofa, on the phone, refers to some notes he's taken.
HAYWARD
Ed, I just talked with the Saeger-Swenson Clinic in
Seattle. Nadine's problems might be related to
something called pheochromo crytoma; effects the
adrenal gland, it could account for her strength and, uh,
erratic behavior. I'll let you know.
As Doc is hanging up Donna a defiant descent of the stairs, hoping her father will notice
her. Takes out a cigarette and lights it.
HAYWARD
I'd like to talk to you, Donna.
DONNA
I gotta go.
HAYWARD
Meeting James?
DONNA
Writing a book?
Hayward points to a chair and Donna begrudgingly sits.
HAYWARD
You missed two days of school last week. Without an
excuse.
DONNA
I had ... I was busy.
HAYWARD
Donna, we've always been able to talk. If there's
something going on you'd like to share with DONNA
There's nothing going on HAYWARD
I have to reluctantly admit I don't believe you - and
there've been other things as well, both your mother and
I are concerned 




 
DONNA
I don't know. Since Laura died everything's different HAYWARD
You may feel that it is but DONNA
Dad, I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now HAYWARD
I think it's very important that. we talk about it DONNA
It doesn't have anything to do with you HAYWARD
Donna, don't shut us out of your life DONNA
I have to, I'm sorry HAYWARD
Donna Donna puts her cigarette out and leaves. Pause. Doc empties the ashtray into a waste basket.

 INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Lucy is making coffee when Andy comes in. She gives him no focus. Cooper enters the
station behind them.
ANDY
Lucy?
(silence)
Lucy, we need to talk LUCY
(furious)
I thought you preferred the company of your
MAGAZINES!
Andy cowers. Her raised voice brings Truman out of the CONFERENCE ROOM. Lucy
slams coffee paraphenalia around.






 
COOPER
Andy, maybe you'd like to get some air.
Andy obediently steps outside.
COOPER 
Lucy, I think we're at the point where it would be
healthier for everyone if you got whatever was eating you
out in the open.
LUCY
(nods, pause)
Andy and I used to go out.
COOPER
That much I've gathered.
LUCY
For a year and a half until I began to notice things about
him. They weren't big things. They were little things.
He never exercises. He never washes his car, and he
doesn't own a sports coat.
COOPER
Uh-huh, and did you do something about this?
LUCY
After watching a television show, I decided I needed
some "me" time, during which we didn't see each other,
during which period I met Dick Tremayne, Horne's
Department Store, Men's Fashions. He had many coats
and keeps himself and his car in good shape. Most of
his behavior was asinine, but at least he was different.
COOPER
Are you still seeing this Dick?
LUCY
No.
COOPER
Do you want to get back with Andy?
LUCY
I don't know.
COOPER
Well, then Lucy, what exactly do you want?






 (2)
LUCY
(a strangulated cry)
I don't know!
Lucy ends in loud, protracted tears and wanders off. Cooper is completely stumped. Shrugs
to Truman. Truman shakes his head.
COOPER
I was trying to help.
TRUMAN
It's a nice thought. But it's like trying to fix the potholes
on Highway  One heavy rain ...

COOPER
I see. You've been down this road before.
Truman nods. Cooper remembers something, checks the hallway for privacy.
COOPER
Harry, I've got a dangerous situation. I've examined it
from every possible angle. Front to back, top to
bottom. And I believe there is only one way to proceed.
(beat)
I'm asking a favor. Strictly between us.
TRUMAN
What's up?
COOPER
I need one of the Bookhouse Boys. Your best man. It
would be better if you didn't know why.
TRUMAN
I've stayed clear when you asked me to and helped when
you needed it. But Coop, I've got to put my oar in here.
COOPER
What do you mean?
TRUMAN
You're not getting a little too personal with your work,
are you?





 (3)
COOPER
Absolutely not.
TRUMAN
Say no more. I'll set it up; nine-thirty at the Roadhouse?
COOPER
Harry S. Truman, you're a citizen.
CUT TO:
 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Norma and Hank are putting finishing touches on a cosmetic overhaul; tablecloths, candles
and flowers in every booth. Hank wears a starched shirt. A nondescript, portly MAN appears
at the diner door, briefcase in hand. Norma calls Hank attention to him.
NORMA
Could be.
HANK
Here we go.






 
Norma moves to him.
NORMA
Good evening, sir, welcome to the Double R.
MAN
Thanks. Could I get a booth?
NORMA
Right this way, please.
She leads him to a booth, he settles in, she hands him a menu.
NORMA 
I'll be back to tell you about the specials.
MAN
No need. I want a cheeseburger, medium, a coke and
some fries.
NORMA
(hiding her disappointment)
Very good.
The Man's back is to a PORTLY CUSTOMER in the booth behind him, sloppily and noisily
hoovering a hamburger, using his shirt for a napkin. Hank causally strolls past the Man, picks
up the Portly Customer's plate and takes him by the arm towards the kitchen.
HANK
Why don't we finish up in the kitchen.
Hank ushers him into the kitchen. OFF CAMERA a number of pots and pans crash. Hank
reemerges, meets Norma behind the counter, as Norma puts the order on the service wheel.
NORMA
All he wanted was a cheeseburger.
HANK
Must be some sort of food critic trick.
The Man gets up and comes towards Hank and Norma. They smile nervously.
MAN
Bathroom?
HANK
Right this way, sir.






 (2)
Hank shows him to the bathroom. On his way back, Hank straightens out some of the little
bouquets in each of the booths making his way to the "critic's" booth. The Man has left his
sports coat on the seat. Hank reaches in and TAKES OUT A WALLET.
CUT TO:
 MADDY IN A BOOTH
Maddy sits and eyes the door. She's nervous. Donna enters, steps toward her. There is much
tension between them.
MADDY
Hi.
(Donna nods)
Thanks for coming. I didn't know ...
DONNA
(as she sits)
Know what?
MADDY
I didn't know if you were mad or not. How mad.
DONNA
I'll survive.
Donna lights a cigarette. Maddy pauses. She's not used to Donna's tough-girl poses.
MADDY
Donna, there's going on between me and James.
DONNA
(calmly)
What if there is? I mean who said James and I couldn't
see other people? I certainly didn't.
MADDY
Are you saying you're seeing someone?
Donna pauses to exhale a little smoke. She eyes Maddy for a moment. Then:
DONNA
Maddy, I need your help.
MADDY
How?
DONNA
Harold Smith has Laura's diary.




27A.

 
MADDY
(with disbelief)
But I thought the Sheriff has Laura's diary.
DONNA
Harold says Laura had a second diary she never told me
about and he's got it.
MADDY
God. We should tell James about this.
DONNA
(firm)
This has nothing to do with James,.
MADDY
But he's been a part of this all along 







 (2)
DONNA
(tamping out her cigarette)
If Laura did have a secret diary and he's got it, I'm
going to get it. With or without your help.
Donna rises, exits without another word. Maddy sighs, watches her go. Donna steps past
Hank, behind the counter. He seizes a quiet moment to open the wallet. An identification
card inside reads:
DARYL LODWICK
ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY
STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
Hank reacts; disappointment and opportunity.

 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
Josie models a new negligee. Truman sits stoically.
JOSIE
I know I paid too much for it, but I fell in love with
it ... I heard the salesman say, "The only reason we're still
in business is because Josie Packard buys retail."
TRUMAN
It's nice.
Josie kisses him. Truman doesn't respond. She feels his check and then his hands.
JOSIE
You're so cold.
TRUMAN
Josie, I have to ask you this ... were you really in Seattle?
JOSIE
Yes. Why are you so suspicious? Look at these boxes,
you think I got these at the Cash and Carry?
(it's not selling; changes tactics)
Besides, you know I had to get away. I was afraid.
TRUMAN
Afraid of Catherine.





 
JOSIE
You know why.
TRUMAN
And now Catherine is dead.
She looks at him. Startled, almost amused.
JOSIE
Harry, you don't think I ...
TRUMAN
I don't know what I think.
JOSIE
You think that I could bum the mill? That I would
deliberately ruin everything of mine?
TRUMAN
There's insurance money.
Pause.
JOSIE
My God ... how could you? How could you think such
terrible things?. How could you hurt me so?
She turns away. Weeps quietly. Truman melts.
TRUMAN
Josie ... Josie?
She turns back. He holds her. It complicates into a kiss, then passion.
JOSIE
I want you... I want you to take me.
They kiss again. Truman starts to lose himself.
TRUMAN
Josie ...
JOSIE
Tear it. Tear it.
She bites his neck. He rips the back of her negligee. She gasps, trembling. He grabs her
violently by the shoulders.





TRUMAN
What do I mean to you?
JOSIE
I love you. I need you.
TRUMAN
Don't play with me.
JOSIE
I want you.
She proves it. Truman slowly loses to his passion.
JOSIE
I want you ... more than my own life.
They kiss, without control. They roll over and over again until they are below a draped
window. The CAMERA MOVES UP the drapes. Behind the blinds in the kitchen, watching
and enjoying is Jonathan, the Asian Man.

Say good lookin', who do you have to grease to get a
cup of coffee around here?
LUCY
Judge Sternwood, hello Your Honor.
STERNWOOD
Lucy, you're a cool drink of water to road-weary eyes.
What is your secret?
LUCY

I'd rather not talk about it sir.
STERNWOOD

Give us a hug.

Life is hard, dear.

Still and all, harder in most places than Twin Peaks.
Truman enters the station.

Clinton, sorry I'm late STERNWOOD
I've only just arrived. What's her name, Harry?
TRUMAN

she won't take the saddle you've got two options. I
won't bore you with either one of 'em Cooper enters from Truman's office.
TRUMAN

COOPER

STERNWOOD
How are you, lad?

You two should have a lot in common.
Lucy hands Sternwood a coffee.
STERNWOOD
Thank you, dear. Harry, break the seal on that bottle of
Irish you've got stashed for me and let's put our feet up.
Sid'll bring in the calender soon as the Winnebago's
tanked up.

Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of the
world?
COOPER
Heaven, sir.
STERNWOOD
This week heaven includes arson, multiple homicides
and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.
COOPER
Heaven's a large and interesting place.
STERNWOOD

TREYMAYNE
I've been a fool, a cad, the way I've behaved. I am
deeply, deeply ashamed.
LUCY
You are?
TREYMAYNE
I must have been over it in my mind a million times and
what I've come to is this: I have to, no, I must ... do the
right thing.
LUCY
You must?
TREYMAYNE
(gives her an envelope)
It's everything I could scrape together, dear. I am
completely knackered.
Lucy looks in the envelope. Cash.
LUCY
What is this?
TREYMAYNE
Six hundred and fifty. I, uh, called around. I'm told
this should be more than adequate.

wallet, turn right, step through both sets of doors, the
second ones stick sometimes, go out to the parking lot,
get into your car, turn the key - AND NEVER SPEAK

Say one more word I'm going to scream. Leave, please.

You've appeared before me many times. I know you to

Thank you, Mr. Pete. Josie has told so much about you.
PETE
So you've come over to visit us from Hong Kong.
JONATHAN
Yes. Hong Kong.
PETE
Josie tells me you run the best little fish market in town.
JONATHAN
I don't know. Very competitive.
JOSIE
I'm afraid cousin is in need of some good old American
how-now.
PETE
That's know-how, all you need, Jon, is a good contact
here can air cargo you some King salmon, fresh, daily.
Run those other rascals right out of business.
Jonathan laughs, smiles shyly, toes the carpet.
JOSIE
Pete, could cousin have some joe? After his long flight
it will help him reset his biographical clock.
PETE

Biological. Cup 'a joe, coming right up.
Pete exits. Jonathan drops the act. His voice is lower; accent Brtisih, clipped, urbane.

I don't know how you've lasted six years. Nothing but
hayseeds and manual laborers.

We all have our job to do.
JONATHAN
Yours is nearly finished. The sale of the mill and the

JONATHAN
Will that be difficult?

No.

We're expected back in Hong Kong.

Are there any other ... complications?

Certainly not.

What about this sheriff?

He means nothing to me.

 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
The darkened interior of the diner after hours. A doorbell is HEARD. A beat. Hank Jennings
steps into the room wearing sweats, a sleepy expression, turns on an interior light, opens the
front door. Nobody's there. Mutters, turns off the lights, and heads back to bed.
A beat. And the doorbell RINGS a second time. A quiet noise is heard. And appliance
lights, dim illumination, go dark in the shadows.
HANK'S VOICE
What the ...?
Hank Jennings stumbles back into view. He tries the light switch. But this time nothing. The
room remains dark. Hank fumbles through a drawer, produces a flashlight. He turns it on.
Suddenly: the beam reveals Jonathan, the Asian Man. Hank reacts with surprise. He keeps
the beam trained on the Asian Man's face, as if to blind him.
HANK
(cool and calm)
Okay. What's the deal? What do you want?
Hank makes his move. He swings the heavy flashlight at the Asian Man's head. But the Asian
Man dodges the weapon with ease, catches Hank at the elbow, directs him forward, crashing
into tables and chairs. The flashlight rolls on the floor, Hank retrieves it, gets to his feet
and aims a high kick at the Asian Man's head. It's a glancing blow, but enough to knock the
man off-balance.
Hank attacks, the Asian man avoids his rush, sends him flying into a large refrigerator. Hank
gasps, regroups. And charges again. This time the Asian Man plows a fist into his midsection,
adds a blow to the back of Hank's neck. Hank lies still on the floor, huffs and puffs.
HANK
Listen, I'm just gonna ... lie here for a while.
The Asian Man kneels, retrieves the flashlight, aims it at him, steps toward Hank. Silent.
HANK
What? What?
The Asian Man stands over Hank, the flashlight aimed at his eyes. Hank puts up his arms to
defend. But the Asian Man simply grabs him by the hand, brings their thumbs together - a
bloodless approximation of Hank and Josie's partner ritual.
JONATHAN
Bloodbrother. Next time I'll take off your head.
He smashes the flashlight against a counter.

Diane, it's 6:42 a.m., a bit of a late start, due to a
persisting soreness in the rib area ...

An ache that feels as if a wing were cut away in my

Diane, a strange dream to report: I dreamt I was
eating a large, tasteless gumdrop. I soon awoke to
realize I was aggressively munching on one of my
Air-Pillow Silicon Ear Plugs. Hence the
tastelessness. I suspect some unexpressed feeling of
aggression is responsible.

Diane, rather than equilibrate through the use of my
gravity boots, which could induce further rib
separation, this morning I'm going to attempt a

That's what we're here for. Let's take
Pinkle inspects the electrical engine that, along with the rest of the host, looks to be quite
antiquated. Bobby sits in the loose body sling connected to an overhead bar by two sagging
crossing chains, giving this crane-like device the look of a silvery praying mantis.
SHELLY
Mr. Pinkle are you going to put in a ramp.
PINKLE
Ah... sure. I've got some plywood, uh, pinewood
ramp boards I'll install outside. Absolutely.
Pinkle finds the switch to start the engine.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Okay, here we go.
He flips the switch. Nothing happens.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
That's a new wrinkle. It was working the other day.
Pinkle fiddles with the cord to the socket. Nothing. Suddenly the engine starts. The bar jerks
up and the chains snap tight across a frightened Bobby, who's yanked up from his seat and
tossed back down. Then the machine stops. Flashing Pinkle a homicidal look, Bobby fights his
way out of the chains, sling, and chair.
SHELLY
Bobby, 'you alright?







BOBBY
How about getting Mr. Pinkle a cold drink?
As Shelly leaves, Bobby pulls Pinkle aside by the back of his neck.
BOBBY
That thing's a death trap, Pinkle. I told you we have
to keep him alive.
PINKLE
Insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the

Shelly returns. Pinkle takes the soda and dives into tinkering with the machine.

His response is a passionate stare. She smolders back. With Pinkle about, they can do no
more than look and want. But outside ... Bobby takes her hand.
BOBBY
Come on, he can let himself out.
They exit. Pinkle, studies the non-working hoist. After a moment he climbs up into the sling.
Testing. He shouts back to Bobby.

Pinkle reaches down and hits the switch a couple of time; finally, the bar lifts, the chains
tighten and the salesman rises.

STERNWOOD
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of
murder in the first degree. Defense has requested
bail. This is a pretrial hearing to determine if that
bail will be granted. Mr. Prosecutor ...
LODWICK
We, the people of the state of Washington, move that
the defendant be denied bail on the basis of: 1)the
great seriousness of the crime for which he's been
accused; 2) the apparently premeditated nature of
this act; and 3) the oft-witnessed instability of Mr.
Palmer during the period following the death of his
daughter.
All eyes are on Leland as Lodwick sits.
STERNWOOD
Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.
TRUMAN
Mr. Palmer is a well-known, respected member of
this community, with a good professional reputation
and established roots. And beyond that ... I'd like
to say that none of us can really know what it's like to
lose a seventeen year-old daughter the way he did.
What that might do to any one of us ...
(suddenly self-conscious)
That's all.
Sternwood deliberates. Truman takes his seat beside Andy, who is glancing up and over a
row up at Leland's partial profile. Truman glances down at the sketchpad in Andy's lap and
sees ...
Andy's sketch of Leland, from the same angle as just seen by Truman: a profile favoring the
back left side of the head.
Andy notices Truman's attention.
ANDY
I thought I might sell this to the Gazette. They
seem to like courtroom sketches.
TRUMAN
You might try for a little more of his face. Just a
suggestion.




 
ANDY
Good. Thanks, Sheriff.
Sternwood gavels.
STERNWOOD
On the basis of his high standing in the community,
the pristine nature of his public and private
reputation and his evident respect for the letter of the
law, which is well known to me ... defendant is
released on his own recognizance. Leland, as you
know, I'll require you to remain in town, making
your whereabouts known to the Sheriff on a regular

Leo Johnson competency hearing. Judge Sternwood is holding court, facing Prosecutor
Lodwick and JACK RACINE, a sardonic defense attorney representing Leo Johnson.
We begin CLOSE ON a blown-up photograph of Leo Johnson, before and after injury and a
diagram on an easel Racine is showing to the judge and closeby gallery area, occupied by
Cooper, Truman, and Shelly Johnson. The diagram is of two EEG waves, one large and
varied, the other flat and undisclosing.
RACINE
You can see by these EEG's, the one above, which is
actually of my own head and intended to show
normal brain activity . The line below is of Mr.
Johnson and shows minimal activity. The previously
submitted medical report states that Mr. Johnson has
suffered diffuse brain damage. He isn't currently
even capable of taking the standard CST
competency tests. We therefore submit that trying
this individual would constitute a mockery of the
justice system, a proceeding the unfortunate young
man wold not even faintly comprehend.
Racine withdraws.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Prosecutor.
Lodwick stands, takes a posturing step toward an almost empty gallery, and accidentally
makes eye contact with Shelly Johnson before folding back toward the judge.
LODWICK
I know that Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape. On
the surface, it might seem ridiculous to make him
stand trial. But a trial doesn't just punish a
wrongdoer; it also brings a feeling of justice and
retribution to a community. Among the various
crimes he's suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer
is the sort that can wound an entire town.






 
LODWICK 
For there to be even a shred of feeling that the
perpetrator of this terrible crime got away with it (Sternwood starts to wave him off)
- this simply cannot be. As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath, he is as eminently deserving of a
trial as this community is of a resolution STERNWOOD
All right, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick. You fellas catch
your breath, I'm going to need to deliberate.

Sid contentedly goes to work behind the bar, concocting an elaborate drink. Cooper and
Truman flank Sternwood at the bar.

Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the
eye. I didn't think he'd press on the murder charge.
Is Leo Johnson your man?
COOPER
No, sir, I don't believe he is.
STERNWOOD
Harry, what's the town's temperature? Do they want
a trial or a lynching?
TRUMAN
They want the right man brought to justice.
STERNWOOD
Then they don't a need a circus. This poor bastard
seems to be a head of cabbage. Thoughts, Cooper?
COOPER
I feel the right man will eventually be apprehended.
Sid brings Sternwood his drink. With full ritualistic relish, Sternwood lights a cigar. Looks

a newly calligraphic menu. Maddy hurries into the diner. Stops short when she sees James.
Tries to look past him looking for a waitress
JAMES
Hi.
MADDY
Hi.
(to the waitress)
Can I get a coffee to go?
JAMES
Seen Donna today?
MADDY
No, sorry. You?
JAMES
No. What's with the coffee?
MADDY
Coffee? It's for Uncle Leland.
JAMES
You don't have coffee at home?
MADDY
(receiving the coffee)
James, I can't talk now. I need to go.




 (2)
JAMES
You need to go?
(no response from Maddy)
Where are you going?
MADDY
Home. Bye, James.
Maddy leaves. James probingly watches. Waits. Then gets up and follows her out. Norma
and Hank exit from the kitchen, Norm carrying a plate of food. She points out Tojamura to
Hank.
NORMA
Louise said he checked into the Great Northern under
the name of Tojamura. This must be the food critic.
HANK
Does he have ponytail?
(Norma nods "yes")
I think he's been here already.
NORMA
What? When?
HANK
Let me handle this.
Hank takes the plate from Norma, moves towards Tojamura carrying the sliced turkey and
mashed potatoes smothered with gravy. Norma looks on anxiously from the back of the
room. Hank glides up and slides the plate through the air, holding it for an instant under
Tojamura's.
HANK
Our specialty.
He then shoves the back of the Asian's head forward, ramming his face into the gravy
mountain of mashed potatoes. Hank drops the plate on the table, slaps his palms clean in selfsatisfaction, and looks back at a stunned Norma.
HANK 
This guy's no critic, he's a ...
Tojamura's mud-and-cloud face rises. Hank glances down. Realizes. Wrong Asian. He looks
back at Norma's Face of Death.

 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT
The last half hour before closing up. ANDY BRENNAN concludes a bravura evening
manning the switchboard. His chest and surrounding area are covered with yellow post-it
notes.
ANDY
(into phone)
No, sir, I'm sure not the regular girl. She's gone to
Tacoma to visit her sister. There's supposed to be a
number for her written down here somewhere.
Andy begins to look for it, but that's not what the caller is concerned about. Andy listens to
him for a moment.
ANDY 
Well, I'm certainly not a lawyer, sir, but my
interpretation of the law would be that if your
neighbor's cow has each of his four hoofs completely
on his property, but his head is stretched over into
your property and he's chewing up your ...
(listens)
Well, I'm certainly no veterinarian, but I think that
would kill the cow. Right. Okay. Bye.
Andy disconnects. A pause in the action brings him to his moment of truth. He takes out a
scribbled piece of paper. Exhales. Dials.
ANDY 
(into phone)
Yeah, I'm calling for some test results. Doc
Hayward said I could just call you an ... what's it
for? It was for a ...
(stage whisper)
Semens analysis. Brennan. Andy.
(waiting)
Yes? Uh, could you go slow, I want to write all this
down.
(writes)
Oligospermia. That sounds terrible. I have that?
(blank)
Oh, I had it. "Too few sperms." Had it? You mean
I'm cured?
(writes; repeats as he does so)
Doc said, "They're not just three guys on a fishing
trip,





 
ANDY 
they're a whole damned town." Yeah, l know what
that means; they're not really real people, they're ...
okay, thank you. Thanks very much.
Andy hangs up. He is overjoyed. Truman peeks out of his office curious about Andy's
excitement. Andy turns to him.
ANDY
I'm a whole damned town.

COOPER
This is what I saw at One-Eyed Jack's. Main bar

Get-acquainted Room.
HAWK enters. Cooper adroitly sweeps the map to the side, a move the deputy notices.
HAWK
The one-armed man's been staying at a motel on
Highway  No one's seen him for the last day, dayand-a-half. His room looks lived in. I found this.
Hawk empties a paper bag of SYRINGES and several VIALS OF LIQUID.
HAWK 
Same drug, as before.
(taking a whiff of it)
Weird, deep smell.
COOPER
We're still waiting for Albert's analysis. Good
work, Hawk.
Hawk grabs a look at the plans. Truman dismisses Hawk's concern.
TRUMAN
See you in the morning, Hawk.
Hawk exits. Cooper breaks the floor plans back out.
COOPER
We'll approach thru the woods from the back. Scale
this hill to the rear door.




 
TRUMAN

COOPER
Inside are stairs that lead down to the rooms. And

Maddy sits behind the front bushes, coffee cup in hand, eyes fixed on Harold Smith's
bedroom window.
CUT TO:
 INT. HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Donna and Harold sit together as before, she on the chair, he behind the desk. Harold opens
the diary with quiet ceremony. Quietly, with muted intensity, he begins:
HAROLD
(as he writes)
Donna Hayward. Tuesday. March the seventh.
Second session.
Harold looks up at Donna, waits for her to begin. Donna pauses, tongue-tied, a little
embarrassed. She sips from her glass of wine, as if to seek inspiration. Harold offers a
comforting smile. And some unexpected humor:
HAROLD
(gentle prompting)
"Dear Diary ...
Donna smiles, shrugs.
HAROLD
Tell me a story.
DONNA
What kind?
HAROLD
Anything you like. It's a diary. Filled with loves
and hates.





 
DONNA
(as it to decide upon the theme)
Loves.
HAROLD
Good.
A beat. Harold waits for her to begin. Takes a sip from his own glass of wine. Finally:
DONNA
Uhm ... "Dear Diary ..."
(to Harold)
This is from a long time ago. Is that okay?
(he nods assent)
All right. Uhm ... I'm thirteen years old. Fourteen
maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest shortest
skirts. Too tight, but Laura talks me into it. And we
go to the roadhouse to meet boys.
Donna pauses. Harold watches her intently, writes as he listens. The room is suddenly very
quiet and still. Almost eerie. As Donna gains the confidence to remember:
DONNA
Their names are Josh, Rick, and Tim. About twenty
years old . A nd they're nice to us, they treat us like
we're older. Rick asks if we want to parry and Laura
says yes.
(beat)
There's a stream in the woods. It seems pale and
light out. The boys build a fire. I like Tim the
best. He isn't so full of loud jokes like the others.
(beat)
Rick gets out a bottle of vodka and Laura starts
drinking. I can't believe how much she drinks. She
hands it to me. I take a sip. It feels good.
(beat)
Laura starts to dance around the boys. Moving her
hips back and forth. Rick starts to clap. But Tim
doesn't do anything. He just watches. Somehow that
makes me mad. So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."
(beat)






 (2)
DONNA 
We take off our clothes. I know the boys are
watching us. The water feels really warm. The boy's
legs are white and I can see them under the water.
When Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick, I don't know
what to do. So I swim away. I think maybe I want
to run but I don't. Tim swims over to me. I let him
kiss me. And I let him touch me. Once.
(beat)
When we leave, and this is what I remember best, the
boys are really nice. They don't make fun or talk
down to us. And Tim ... Tim kisses my hand when
we say goodbye. Then he kisses me.
(beat)
I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and
sweet. My heart sort of jumps. He's talking to me
but I don't really hear him. Just the kiss.
(beat)
I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever
fell in love. But Laura ...
Donna exhales, a little overwhelmed. Tears shine in her dark eyes.
DONNA
That's all.
(embarrassed; re tears)
Sorry.
HAROLD
That was beautiful, Donna.
Harold closes the diary.
CUT TO:



 INT. HAROLD SMITH'S GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a cymbidium orchid. Pale yellow and red. Quite beautiful. Harold
Smith's voice is HEARD.
HAROLD'S VOICE
Most people imagine orchids growing in exotic
steamy jungles. But you can grow them anywhere
with the right kind of care. I mean it's all basically
water and light, isn't it? Here. Look.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Harold and Donna in the greenhouse. Artificial light. Rows of
potted orchids. Harold delicately holds an orchid in his palm.
DONNA
It's beautiful.
HAROLD
(a quiet obsession)
Humidity is paramount. The control of it, I mean.
Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.
(pointing to appropriate parts)
Three sepals, three petals bottom petal shaped
like a lip is called the labellum.
DONNA
The colors ...
HAROLD
(re labellum)
It's a landing platform, really. For pollinating
insects.
Donna's fingers touch the petal. Then brush against Harold's hand.
DONNA
It's sort of romantic.
Harold now takes Donna's hand into his own. She turns toward him. And they kiss with
greater intensity than before. Something akin to passion. A beat. Harold steps back from her.
HAROLD
(with vague apprehension)
Will you excuse me for a minute?





 
DONNA
Sure.
Harold steps away into his bedroom. The SOUND of running water is HEARD. Donna
reaches into her purse, grabs the flashlight. And races toward the front window.
CUT TO:
 EXT. HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Maddy SEES the tiny window flashes. She rises up from behind the bushes and does an
eggshell walk toward the bungalow door.
CUT TO:
 EXT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Re-establish. Hank stands in the shadows, watches something in the near distance. He speaks
into a cellular telephone with quiet urgency.
HANK
(into phone)
Ben, we've got a problem. The drop at the merry-goround's not for two hours and Cooper's at One-Eyed
Jack's. And he's not alone.
CUT TO:
 EXT. AROUND BACK - NIGHT
Up over a hillside ridge, a walkway runs just the back French doors. ANGLE ON a GUARD
on patrol. He hears a NOISE behind him and starts to reach for his gun, but there's suddenly
a strong yank on his arm. Truman stuffs a rubber ball into his mouth and almost
simultaneously slaps into handcuffs behind his back. Then from another pocket in his jacket,
he seals the ball in place with tape. Cooper inspects Truman's JACKET. A modified fishing
vest loaded with burglary tools. Cooper nods appreciatively. Gestures forward.
They approach the back door. Locked. Truman plants in odd piece of iron between the
French doors. Props it between the French doors, pushes the doors in and as they bounce
back out and OPEN.
CUT TO:
 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman enter atop a long, ill-lit stairway. They look about, alert, ready for
anything, then start down the stairs. Party sounds abound from the adjoining main rooms.
Cooper and Truman walk past the first hallway of noise, the casino, gliding by, trying to
make themselves invisible. As they approach the next level, a GIRL leads a CUSTOMER out
into the hall.





 
They, freeze against the wall: She looks up the stairs and happily prances right past them, a
little drunk, not seeing. Cooper and Truman exhale. They descend past this level toward the
darkness of the bottom floor.
CUT TO:
 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman move stealthily down the hallway. They near Blackie's office, a window,
their view limited by drooping red curtains. Truman peers inside. Signals "two" occupants to
Cooper. Cooper gestures a reply. Stay put. I'll circle in the other direction. HOLD ON
Truman for a beat, as he scoots closer, tries to get a better look inside.
CUT TO:
 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper moves quietly down the hall, looking left and right. Suddenly a woman appears. It's
Nancy, Blackie's sister. Cooper doesn't hesitate.
COOPER
(coldly determined)
Please take me to Audrey Horne. Now.
NANCY
(figuring her options)
I don't think she's available.
Cooper takes out his pistol.
COOPER
Let's double check.
Cooper takes Nancy by the arm. Allows her to lead him forward.
CUT TO:
 INT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a video monitor showing Cooper playing blackjack. ANOTHER ANGLE
reveals Jean Renault, glancing at the screen from time to time. He holds a small spoon in one
hand, a lighter in the other. He fixing a hot shot for Audrey. Blackie watches, waits.
BLACKIE
(re hot shot)
Not such a bad way to go. All things considered.




 
RENAULT
Is she alone?
BLACKIE
Nancy's with her.
(jealousy)
What does she do for you that I can't?
RENAULT
(quiet smile)
You do all right.
Renault loads the syringe with a practiced hand. Everything proceeds in business-like fashion.
Blackie steps a little closer, eyes on the drugs that remain.
CUT TO:
 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Truman leans against the wall, having witnessed much of the latter. He looks down the
hallway for Cooper, some sign. But sees and hear nothing. Truman scoots a little closer to the
office door. Considers his next move.
CUT TO:
 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cooper and Nancy enter the bedroom. Cooper sees Audrey, dazed, bound up on the bed.
He gives Nancy a quick stare: of controlled rage. She equivocates:
NANCY
It's not my idea, okay? We're nothin' but meat on a
hook to these people.
(imploring)
I'll do whatever I can to help. Serious.
Cooper's not listening. He kneels at Audrey's side.
COOPER
Audrey. Can you hear me?
AUDREY
(slipping in and out)
Mmmmm ... Who ... ? ... My ... my prayers ...





 
COOPER
(quiet, intense)
Audrey, I'm going to take you out of here now.
Cooper hears the sound of brushing silk. He reacts, turns in time to SEE Nancy take a stiletto
out of her boot. Her hand sweeps forward, blade flashing. Cooper shifts to avoid. But the
steel catches his arm, rips and tears. Cooper grabs Nancy's wrist with his free hand, wrenches
the knife from her grasp, sends her sprawling with a punch to the jaw. She's out cold.
Cooper retrieves the knife, cuts Audrey's ropes. He bundles her in the top blanket, takes
Audrey into his arms. Cooper moves as quickly as is possible. He knows he is running out of
time.
CUT TO:
 INT./EXT. BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Truman watches as Renault places the loaded syringe in his pocket Steps toward the door.
Blackie follows, now steps in his path. She smirks, sidles into Renault's arms. A deep kiss.
Truman crouches by the doorway, reaches for his pistol. Ready for action. Just then: the
unmistakable WHISTLE of Renault's spring-loaded KNIFE.
Blackie gasps, sags. Feels the blade enter her torso. Renault removes the knife, releases her.
Blackie falls dead from his embrace to the floor.
Truman reacts with shock. pistol in hand, he stands, turns toward the office.
Inside the office, Renault spots Truman. He reaches for a pistol, FIRES. Truman ducks for
cover. Renault's bullet strikes a window, glass shatters, flies. Truman marine crawls to a
better vantage point. He rolls, pistol aimed, ready to fire, but Renault is GONE.
CUT TO:
 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S -CORRIDOR
Cooper hurries down the corridor, Audrey in his arms. Truman meets him from the opposite
direction. Neither has time for conversation. They turn toward the nearest exit. Truman leads
the way. Suddenly: another BODYGUARD appears between them and the exit. He holds a
gun in his hands. Means to use it.
BODYGUARD
Drop the gun.
Truman deliberately places his gun on the floor. Cooper holds Audrey tightly in his arms,
says nothing. The bodyguard's gun cocks. Then a hollow drum-like SOUND. Truman turns
to see the guard fall forward, a bowie knife lodged deep between his scapulas. Halfway up
the stairs is Hawk.
HAWK
Good thing you guys can't keep a secret.
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk dart up the stairs.
CUT TO:
 EXT. THE HIGH RIDGE - NIGHT
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk are VIEWED from a HIGH ANGLE. Racing with Audrey into
the shadows.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be Hank's POV. He speaks into the cellular phone:
HANK
(into phone)
There's been gun fire. Cooper and Truman are
leaving with your daughter .....
A GUN moves into FRAME, pointed at Hank's head. Hank hangs up without another word.
SHOT EXPANDS to show Jean Renault holding the pistol.
Hank's hands slowly go up. Renault reaches over into Hank's coat pocket and pulls out a
wallet. Opens it. He reacts with surprise.

Is something wrong?
Harold turns toward the window. Donna moves to intercept.
DONNA
No. You scared me a little that's all. I ...
Harold pulls free from her grasp, steps to the window. Donna nearly pleads.
DONNA
Tell me about the orchids. This one ...
Too late. Harold stalks forward.

 INT. HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Maddy excitedly reaches for the diary with Laura's name embossed upon it. She pulls it out

anger.

 INT. HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Maddy stands frozen near the hidden bookshelf, Laura's diary in her hands. Harold puts
himself between her and the door, armed with the metal tool. Donna reaches for his arm, he
rips free from her grasp, shoves her toward Maddy and the hidden books.
Maddy and Donna stand together, breathless, afraid. Harold Smith pauses, just stares at them
for a beat Feels the black weight of their betrayal. Then, quietly, almost a whisper, he speaks:
HAROLD
Are you looking for secrets? Is that it? Maybe I can
give you one. Do you want to know what the
ultimate secret is? Laura did.
(eyes flaring)
The secret of knowing who killed you.
Maddy screams.

SUDDENLY: HAROLD SMITH looms, gardening tool in hand. It arcs through the air,
smashes Laura's diary out of MADDY FERGUSON'S hands. Maddy screams, backs toward
the door. But DONNA HAYWARD remains frozen in place, ashen, as Smith turns to her.
He speaks quietly at first, almost puzzled. And quite mad.
SMITH
I trusted you. I invested my heart and my soul in you.
DONNA
We only wanted to read it, I didn't MADDY
Donna, run!
SMITH
(mounting fury)
I thought you were different. You made me feel I could
return to the world and find something decent and pure.
But you're just like all the others. You lie, you betray, and
then you laugh about it. You are unclean. You have
contaminated me.
Smith raises the tool over his head. Donna remains transfixed. Maddy screams.
MADDY
DONNA!!
Just then: the front door explodes open, JAMES HURLEY tumbles inside. The sound
distracts Smith, Donna regains her senses, turns to run. But then she spots Laura's diary open
on the floor nearby. Donna moves toward it, as if to grab and flee. Smith yells:
SMITH
(he rushes toward the diary)
NO!
JAMES
Donna!
James rushes forward, Smith raises his hand to strike. Donna retreats, James pushes Smith
out of the way, takes Donna by the hand. Maddy joins them as they rush our the door. Smith
kneels to retrieve the diary. He looks at the open door, the black night beyond it. The world
outside. Smith turns and races back to his greenhouse.
CAMERA VIEWS Smith through the large glass panel, his features lurch into view, shadowy,
distorted by the glass. He lets out a howl, but we can't quite hear it behind the thick panes.


Muffled, anguished. It sounds a little like "Laura."

DONNA
Oh James. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

INT. THE BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT
AGENT COOPER carries AUDREY HORNE into the Bookhouse interior. She moans
softly, drifting in and out. DEPUTY HAWK enters behind him. They are met by, a
handsome young man. A Bookhouse Boy named CAPPY.
CAPPY
We're all set up inside.
Cooper nods, no time for conversation. He carries Audrey to a bed inside a curtained area.
Cappy pulls back a blue blanket, assists Cooper as he gently sets Audrey upon it. They work
with quiet, but discernible urgency.
Cooper checks Audrey's pulse, softly placing two fingers upon her neck. He peers into her
eyes, listens to whispered breath.
COOPER
Sluggish pulse. Pupils constricted. Breathing slow and shallow.
Cooper gently lifts her left arm - every time he touches her it is with great care and precision
and checks inside the elbow. Bruises. Red pinpricks.
COOPER
Needle tracks. Most likely heroin.
HAWK
Poor kid.
AUDREY
(faintly)
Daddy? ... Can you see me Daddy?
COOPER
Multiple injections over the course of a two day period.
Audrey, can you hear me?
Audrey says nothing. Her eyes roll back. She nearly loses consciousness. Cooper leans closer.
COOPER
Audrey, you must stay awake. Do you hear me? You've
got to stay awake.
AUDREY
(airy whisper)
Can you catch me? ... Can you ...?
Cooper watches, helpless, uncertain. Then, urgent, emphatic:
COOPER
I want you to talk to me. Audrey, Please.




There's a faint note of desperation in his voice. But Audrey cannot hear it. She's lost in a
heroin fog, she rambles, slips in and out.
AUDREY
His tongue, so heavy ... a hand in my throat ... it hurts me,
Oh God it hurts ...
(she shivers uncontrollably)
Black cold, the lake, black cold ... can't breathe ... help
me, please help me ... I'm sinking ...
Cooper gently gathers Audrey into his arms.
COOPER
I'm here, Audrey. I will stay with you. You're right here.
You're right here with me.
Cooper gently places a hand upon her cheek, offers a healing caress. Suddenly: Audrey's
hand rises into view, takes Cooper by the palm. Holds on tight.
COOPER

She was so brave. I feel terrible. If anything had
happened to her

JAMES
No more plans, okay? No more going off on our own.
DONNA
James, he has Laura's secret diary. He could have killed
her.
JAMES
He could've killed you too.
Donna offers a gentle kiss, looks deep into James' eyes. A beat, then:
DONNA
I feel stupid. Ashamed.
JAMES
After Laura died, everything happened so fast. It's hard
to know exactly what to believe in.
DONNA
(he's read her mind)
Yes.
JAMES
Bur when I saw you tonight I knew exactly what I
believed.
DONNA
Did you?
JAMES
It's like if we could put our hearts together, and keep
them that way forever, we'd be safe no matter what.
DONNA
You and me.
JAMES
From now on.
DONNA
Yes.
James kisses her on the mouth. Donna reacts with whispered repetition.
DONNA
Yes.
They kiss with even greater fervor. Their passion in direct contrast to - or perhaps in
conjunction with - their innocence.

INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Sheriff Truman looks up from a book of mug shots and corresponding paper work as
Cooper enters and slumps, exhausted, into a chair across from him.
TRUMAN
How is she?
COOPER
She's through the worst of it. Heroin.
(Truman reacts)
This close to a lethal dose. Sooner or later the dope
would have been lethal. Hard to imagine that kind of
cruelty.
Truman slides the mug book over to Cooper. Points out a shot.
TRUMAN
Not really. Take a look. Blackie's killer. I knew I'd
seen him before. Jean Renault.
COOPER
"Renault?"
TRUMAN
Eldest to Jacques and Bernard. Hell of a lot more
dangerous.
(hand's Cooper a sheet on Renault)
He runs the northern territories. Drugs, extortion,
gambling; you name it.

TRUMAN 
(putting the pieces together)
There was a tape in Blackie's office of you playing
blackjack the night you and Big Ed visited the casino.
COOPER
(his surmise)
Jean Renault was after me.
TRUMAN
(completing the thought)
The man who caught his brother.
COOPER
(grim)
Renault planned to kill me. And he used Audrey as bait.
It's a deeply troubling revelation. A long beat. Truman comforts, reminds:
TRUMAN
We got her back, Coop. And she's going to be okay.
Cooper doesn't look convinced, a long beat. Then
COOPER
I went out of my jurisdiction twice I've violated my
professional code. And Audrey is paying the price for it.
TRUMAN
We did what we had to do.
COOPER
(beat)
This isn't the first time my actions have brought suffering
to someone I care about. In the name of 'doing what I
thought I had to do.' Dammit. I should have known better.
TRUMAN
That doesn't change the fact that Audrey's here now. Not
up at Jack's with a needle in her arm.
(beat)
You're the best lawman I've ever seen, Cooper. But
sometimes you think too much.
He says the latter with admiration and quiet humor. Cooper appreciates both.
COOPER
Thank you, Harry.

hide it. How much does Cooper know?
BEN
Agent Cooper, I got your call.
(spotting briefcase)
What happened? Did you ... ?
COOPER
We were able to free your daughter without payment.
Cooper hands him the briefcase.
BEN

Thank God.
COOPER
Audrey was being held in a brothel north of the border
known as One-Eyed Jack's.
BEN
(feigning shock)
No.
COOPER
The brothel's Madam was at least partially responsible
for your daughter's kidnapping and subsequent blackmail.
Ben pauses, fearing what Cooper might know. All the things Blackie could have told him.
BEN
Did you arrest her?



COOPER
She was killed before we could question her.

No!

And this Renault, did you catch him?
COOPER
He escaped.
BEN
(more good news)
Too bad.
(opens briefcase, peers at the inside)
Everything seems to be in order.
COOPER
(quietly critical)
Audrey's recovering from a drug overdose.
BEN
(paternal in spite of himself)
Drug overdose? Oh my God.
COOPER
She's going to be all right.
BEN
Can I see her?
COOPER
I wouldn't disturb her now. She's resting, comfortably.
I'll call you in the morning.
Ben doesn't like his tone. But given the time and place, not to mention all the lies he's telling.
BEN
Yes, do that, Agent Cooper. Thank you.
Ben reaches out, takes Cooper into a celebratory hug. It's an odd, awkward gesture.
Unexpected. Completely devoid of feeling.



BEN 
Thank you for bringing my Audrey back to me.
Cooper accepts the embrace. Grudgingly. Then extricates himself, prepatory to leaving
COOPER
Good night, Mr. Horne.
Ben watches, wheels turning, as Cooper steps into the shadows.
FADE TO BLACK

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO
FADE IN:
 INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOME DAY
BOBBY BRIGGS, in sport coat and tie, struggles to push LEO JOHNSON in his wheelchair
through the doorway. It's too tight a fit. Bobby curses under his breath, struggles with the
chair. Maybe he can slide it through sideways.
SHELLY JOHNSON and an Insurance Representative, TOM BROCKMAN, watch Leo's
bumpy progress from the living room. Shelly winces with each shove and bang. Brockman,
fifties, unctuous, offers his best sympathy:
BROCKMAN
Poor fellow, really gone.
BOBBY
(muttered)
You ain't kiddin'.
Bobby finally gets Leo into the living room nearly losing control of the chair, but holds on
tight, manages a grim smile for Brockman. The Insurance Agent returns it.
BROCKMAN
I want you to know how much I admire you kids,
standing by Mr. Johnson. Not taking the easy way out.
Most people would just ship him off.
BOBBY
(as close to piety as he can manage)
Yeah, well, Leo's sorta special to us.
BROCKMAN
Believe you me, in-home care is the stuff of miracles. It
may not always seem that way to you, but Mr. Johnson
should benefit tremendously from his being here among
his loved ones.
SHELLY
(working, a smile into place)
We certainly hope so.
BROCKMAN
(while inspecting bed and winch)
Will you be hiring full or part-time help?
SHELLY
Cousin Bobby and I will be here full-time.




 
BROCKMAN
I admire your dedication.
(concluding, reaching into briefcase)
Everything looks to be in order. You might want to childproof those electrical sockets when you get a chance. Sign
here ...
Brockman extracts a form from his briefcase. Shelly signs it.
BROCKMAN
(returns form to briefcase, hands Shelly envelope)
Your check
Shelly opens it, reacts with disbelief.
SHELLY
There must be some mistake.
Bobby takes the check Looks at it. He can't believe it either.
BOBBY
1700 bucks?
BROCKMAN
(with a sympathetic nod)
Sad, isn't it? The cost of health care is going through the
roof.
BOBBY
It's bringing rain. We're supposed to get five thousand a
month.
BROCKMAN
Figure state and local taxes, equipment fees, medical and
maintinence costs, administrative fees ... you see the
results. Fortunately with you two here Mr. Johnson will
be more than adequately provided for. Good luck
Brockman extends a hand for shaking. Bobby just looks at him for beat, a little dazed. Then
he offers an aimless handclasp. Brockman exits. Shelly turns to Bobby, mortified.
SHELLY
I have to quit my job, Bobby. How am I going to make
it on this?
BOBBY
I don't know.




 (2)
SHELLY
You don't know? Bringing him home was your bright idea
in the first place BOBBY
I'm thinking.
Shelly stops, swallows hard. Fights a few unwanted tears.
SHELLY
Well you'd better think of somethin'. For both of us.
Just then: a quiet noise from Leo's chair. From Leo. It starts somewhere deep his chest,
then pours weakly out his lips. A moan. A protest. Bobby and Shelly both whirl about, stare
at Leo with amazement. His face remains blank. His eyes deeply empty. But the sound
continues, now stutters just a bit. HOLD ON Leo for a beat.
CUT TO:
 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Donna sits before a doubting Sheriff Truman in the Interrogation Room.
TRUMAN
Donna. We, already have Laura Palmer's diary.
DONNA
No, this is her secret diary.
TRUMAN
(dubious)
And she gave it to this "Harold Smith?" Why?
DONNA
I don't know. To hide it or something.
TRUMAN
Did he ever actually show you the diary?
DONNA
No. But he read from it. I saw her name on the inside
cover. Her handwriting.
TRUMAN
Donna, are you and James up to something again, He's
been warned about getting mixed up DONNA
(she can't tell him the whole story)
James has nothing to do with this.
TRUMAN
(doesn't believe her)
I'm sorry, it's a little bit like the boy who cried wolf.
The last time you played this game Dr. Jacoby ended up
in a hospital bed.
DONNA
It's not a game.
TRUMAN
(responding to her sincerity)
All right. I'll try to get someone out there to take a look.
We've got our hands full, I can't promise anything DONNA
Sheriff, please Suddenly: a loud man stands in the doorway, interrupts. His name is GORDON COLE.
COLE
EXCUSE ME! I'M LOOKING FOR A SHERIFF
TRUMAN.
TRUMAN
That's me.
Cole enters, extends a hand. He's in his forties and wears a pink hearing aid in each ear.
COLE
FBI REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF, GORDON
COLE. THAT'S A REAL MOUTHFUL AND I
CAN'T HEAR MYSELF ANYWAY. I'M AGENT
COOPER'S SUPERVISOR.
TRUMAN
Nice to meet you, sir. Excuse me a moment, Donna.
They step out into the hallway.
11A. INT. HALLWAY
COLE
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP. HEARING'S
GONE. LONG STORY. GOT THESE THINGS
CRANKED UP TO THE MAX.
TRUMAN
Are you looking for Agent Cooper?
COLE
WHEN AN AGENT GOES DOWN IN THE FIELD
I JUMP RIGHT UP AND PAY A VISIT.
TRUMAN
Agent Cooper isn't here right now.
COLE
ALBERT ROSENFIELD IS NOT COMING BACK,
BUT I'VE GOT HIS WORK RIGHT HERE.
Truman reacts to Cole's errant conversational rhythms. Cole opens his satchel, refers to
notes.
COLE
ITEM: A VICUNA COAT: FIBERS ALBERT
FOUND IN THE HALL OUTSIDE COOPER'S
ROOM ARE FROM A VICUNA COAT.
TRUMAN
The coat was vicuna?
COLE
NO THANKS. I ALREADY ATE. GOT THE LAB
REPORT FROM ALBERT ON THE ONE
ARMER'S SYRINGE. SAYS HE'S NEVER SEEN A
DRUG LIKE IT. A COMBO: REALLY WIERD
STUFF.
Donna watches their exchange, impatient, ignored for the moment.
TRUMAN
Did Albert say anything else?
COLE
PAPERS FOUND NEAR THE BLOODY TOWEL
DOWN THE TRAIN TRACKS FROM THE
CRIME SITE. FROM A DIARY.
Just then: around the corner, another interruption. DEPUTY HAWK leads an angry PHILLIP
MICHAEL GERARD, the one-armed salesman, towards lock-up.
MIKE
Since when is selling shoes against the law?
COLE
THERE'S THE ONE-ARMER NOW.
TRUMAN
We need to ask you a few questions, Mr. Gerard. Why
don't we all move to my office?
Truman leads them away. Donna comes out of interrogation. HOLD ON Donna for a beat.
She sighs, watches them go. She's got no one to tell her story to.
CUT TO:
 INT. BOOKHOUSE - DAY
START CLOSE on Audrey, asleep, peaceful. Ben Horne's voice is heard:
BEN'S VOICE
She looks like an angel.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Agent Cooper and Ben Horne standing over her. Cooper says
nothing, just looks at Audrey. Then he kneels to wake her.
COOPER
Audrey? You're father is here.
Audrey's eyes flutter open. She's weak, dreamy. Ben comes around from behind Cooper,
crouches at her side.
BEN
Thank god, Audrey. Thank god.
Ben tries to embrace her. But Audrey focuses, realizes who it is. And recoils. Cooper takes
notice. Ben shifts backward, plays the loving father without missing a beat.
BEN
I was so worried about you.
AUDREY
Were you?




 
BEN
(ignoring her tone of voice)
Worried sick. Times like these make a man aware of the
value of life. Every raindrop. Every sunset.
AUDREY
(pointedly)
I'm aware of a lot of new things too.
BEN
(shushes her)
Don't talk now, sweetheart. We're going to get you
home. Safe and warm. In your own bed. God, what a
terrible experience. What terrible people. The things
you must have seen.
AUDREY
(she knows he knows)
I saw so much.
Ben tenses, checks to see if Cooper is listening. He is.
BEN
(wanting to sum it all up)
We'll sort it out. Together.
AUDREY
(a threat)
Yes. You and I, Daddy.
BEN
That's my girl.
(rises, happy to bring this duel to a conclusion; to
Cooper)
My car's outside. I'll take her home now.
AUDREY
Daddy?
Ben turns back to Audrey. Her tone of voice.
BEN
(what now?)
Yes, darling.
AUDREY
I'd like Agent Cooper to take me home. If that's okay
with you.




 (2)
BEN
(flustered, but hiding it well)
Yes. That's Fine. Or ...
(With a cautious look at Cooper)
... we could all go together.
Cooper nods. Wonders what Ben is hiding. And what it is that Audrey knows.
CUT TO:
 INT. ED HURLEY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
NADINE HURLEY enters, carrying some boxes from Horne's.
NADINE
Ed, I'm home!
Ed comes out of the kitchen to see her, wearing a teenager's JUMPER DRESS. She plops
down a bundle of packages, labeled, "HORNE'S JUNIOR MISS DEPARTMENT."
NADINE 
Isn't this the swellest dress you've ever seen? And you
know, they didn't look at me twice when I used the
credit card - say, Ed, when do my folks get back from
Europe, anyway?
ED
(stoically playing along)
Pretty soon.
NADINE
(sultry)
It's neat having the house all to ourselves. Pretend it's
ours. Like we were married or something
ED
We can do that.
NADINE
(with a wink)
I know some or-her stuff we can do.
ED
Like what?
NADINE
You know, silly.
(punches him playfully. It hurts)
You know what I was I thinkin'? Tonight maybe we could
go park by the lake and neck.
ED
Maybe.
NADINE
(beaming ecstatically)
Wait a minute. We don't have to go anywhere. Why we
can stay ... right ... here.
Nadine pulls Ed into a deep kiss. Her incredible new strength, her incredible new sex drive.
It's all a little dodgy for Big, Ed. A beat. Nadine pulls back, suddenly concerned. Reality
keep whispering past her delerium.
NADINE
When are your parents coming home?
Poor, poor Ed.
CUT TO:
 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE LIBRARY - DAY
START CLOSE on JOSIE PACKARD, lying upon a sofa. Her clothing in disarray, tear
tracks on her cheeks. She sits up, unsteady, as if she had been assaulted.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals JONATHAN, the Asian Man, standing over her. He buckles
his belt, adjusts his shirt, looks at her coldly. Boxes are strewn about the floor at his feet;
Josie's shopping purchases, now scattered. Jonathan kneels, paws through the baubles and
wrapping paper as one might the spoils of a war recently won.
JONATHAN
You've kept yourself in fine nick, Josie. Sapphire earrings
... Parisian perfume ... cashmere sweaters, silk blouses.
JOSIE
(quiet and afraid)
Please go.
He reaches into his jacket pocket, produces an envelope, tosses it to Josie. Josie flinches, the
envelope falls to the floor.
JONATHAN
A one-way ticket. Seattle, Hong Kong
JOSIE
I have one more day.
JONATHAN
Keep what you earn. That was the deal.
(with a look at the purchases)
See how much you can fit into your suitcases. We leave

JONATHAN 
tonight.
JOSIE
(afraid to look at him)
Ben Horne hasn't payed me yet; I've been waiting five
years JONATHAN
Mr. Eckhardt will make it more than worth your while.
JOSIE
You can't make me leave Suddenly: Jonathan grabs Josie behind the neck, pulls her forward. Josie shudders, is afraid to
resist. Jonathan offers a cold, hurtful kiss. Then he whispers.
JONATHAN
Be adaptable.
JOSIE
(pleading through her fear)
We had an arrangement ...
Jonathan releases her, now turns his grip into a caress, his fingers tracing her jawbone.
JONATHAN
Sheriff Truman is important to you. You be to him. You
make him into a fool. But he is important to you
nonetheless,
(her silence gives him the answer he needs)
Leave with me tonight. Or I'll kill him.
JOSIE
He doesn't know anything Jonathan's fingers move smoothly from jawbone to lips, silence her. It is a gesture both
violent and sexual.
JONATHAN
The plane leaves at midnight. Be there. Or I will come
for you. And your Sheriff. That's ... the arrangement.
HOLD ON them for a beat.
FADE TO BLACK
END ACT TWO



ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 EXT. LAKE - DAY
James pulls up on his bike, approaches Maddy waiting, by the water. Both a little sad. Both
wiser.
JAMES
I think I owe you an apology.
MADDY
Not really.
JAMES
When we were to together you know, just talking ... I felt
something. I just wasn't sure.
MADDY
(completes his thought)
You looked at me and you saw Laura.
JAMES
I guess I did.
MADDY
Want to know somethin' strange? I liked it.
JAMES
You did?
MADDY
When we were growing up, Laura and I were so close it
was scary. I could feel her thoughts. Like our brains were
connected or something. Our mothers were the same way.
(beat)
When she died suddenly I had a chance to be Laura. At
least other people saw me that way. Like the way you
looked at me. I liked that too.
JAMES
It was wrong.
MADDY
It wasn't one thing or the other. For a while I got to be
somebody different. Now I'm just me again.
James pauses, uncertain. Maddy continues, reassures:




 
MADDY
You and Donna belong together. That's the best thing.
JAMES
(agreeing, confessing)
It's hard sometimes, you know?
MADDY
(simple/direct)
How?
JAMES
If you really love someone, it's like this bright light is
shining on you every minute. You're right in it. It's great.
But I don't think you can stay that way all the time.
MADDY
Sure you can.
JAMES
(looks at her, beat)
I want to. I want to try to make the way my heart feels
last forever. Pretty weird.
Maddy doesn't think it's weird at all. A tender beat. Just a whisper of what might have been
between them. Then Maddy offers a confession of her own:
MADDY
I'm going home tomorrow, James. I came to Twin Peaks
for Laura's funeral. And I stayed for Uncle Leland and
Aunt Sarah, just to help out. But it's time to go ...
JAMES
So this is goodbye or somethin' ...
MADDY
I guess it is.
(with gentle humor)
Bye, James.
She gives him a sweet kiss. He smiles. They separate.
CUT TO:
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY (SUNDOWN)
Ben Horne is pouring two glasses of wine. He hands one glass to someone who is revealed to
be Josie.




 
BEN
Jerry brought back a case from some obscure French
vineyard. I've been saving it for just such a special
occasion as this.
(proposes a toast)
To "The Fire."
Horne takes a sip, then steps behind his desk, sits. A more business-like mien.
BEN 
Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?
JOSIE
I've got the contract with Pete's Signature. I want my
money.
BEN
Of course you do.
JOSIE
All of it. Now. Before you get this.
BEN
Josie, Josie. Surely a mind as quicksilver as your own can
grasp the complicated position we're in. Fluidity is all.
I can't summon up cash reserves I don't have. But I have
already and will be happy to assure you again that as the
contracted payments arrive from Iceland your percentage
will immediately JOSIE
(hot)
I won't leave this office without my money
Pause.
BEN
Why do I sense this isn't a negotiable position? You're
under some kind of pressure, aren't you?
JOSIE
(a cold warning)
Do not ... play games with me.
BEN
Games?
Ben smiles, reaches into a drawer, removes a small gold key. He holds it up for Josie to see.




 (2)
BEN
This key unlocks my personal hotel safe. And inside that
safe, I've put together a fascinating dossier on you, dear
Josie, and husband Andrew's little boat that went boom.
(beat, cold)
So you behave yourself, lady, or, believe me when I say
this ... I will ... bury you.
Josie moves towards him. Shows him a key.
JOSIE
That's a shame. Because if anything unfortunate were to
happen to me, it would lead authorities to a certain safety
deposit box in another city. Inside of which is
enough evident to put you away for three lifetimes.
They'll bury us side by side.
They stare at each other; mongoose and cobra.
BEN
Stalemate.
Now Josie moves towards Ben seductively, holding the contract.
JOSIE
Your move. Cash.
BEN
(pause; an idea)
Happily, I can accomodate you.
He goes back to his desk, retrieves TOJAMURA'S CASHIER'S CHECK and endorses it.
BEN
A sign of my good faith. Tokyo bank. Five million
dollars.
Ben hands the check to Josie. She examines it. Folds it. Puts it away. Hands him the
contract.
JOSIE
We're finished.
BEN
(admiringly)
Well played, Josie.
Ben finishes his wine. She leaves.
CUT TO:



 EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Establish. And, oddly, the sound of MUSIC from within. Kazoos.
CUT TO:
 INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on Leo Johnson. Wheelchair bound, he wears a festive party hat, Ray Ban
shades, and a blank expression. A kazoo hangs from his mouth, it bleats with each jagged
breath. But Leo remains perfectly still. On permanent leave in the Land of Nod.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Bobby and Shelly. Wearing party hats, piping a jaunty tune on
their own kazoos, Auld Lang Syne. Shelly leads Leo to the dinner table, a cake before him.
Bobby acts the mocking Master of Ceremonies.
BOBBY
Leo, we figured with you gettin' out and all, well, what
the hell, we sorta wanted to give you a little party. Our
way of saying, hey, Leo Johnson, welcome home.
SHELLY
(mock dutiful)
Welcome home, darling.
Bobby paces, steps behind Leo. Adjusts his glasses. Tweaks his nose.
BOBBY
Cause you're a special guy, Leo. And we just want you to
know that we remember all the great stuff you did for the
ones you loved.
Bobby pulls up Leo's hat, the elastic chin strap stretches, then Bobby lets it snap back down.
BOBBY
Like Shelly here. Who could ask for a more caring and
thoughtful husband? Makin' her clean your dirty clothes.
Wash your dishes. Mop your floors. You're a class act,
man. Top to bottom.
(kneels, speaks right past his ear)
And how 'bout Leo Johnson, wife abuser? There's a guy
you want to party with. Soap in a sock. Internal injuries
and barely leaves a bruise.
(rises, resumes pacing)
But last, and I'm thinkin' not least, we got Leo Johnson,
murderer. Hang your wife up like a piece of meat.
Leave her to burn. Don't let anybody ever tell ya you
don't know how to treat a woman.
Bobby puts his arms around Shelly. Gives her a deep kiss. Both turn to look at Leo in his
chair, festively decorated, utterly silent.

BOBBY
(the familiar intonation)
"This is your life," Leo Johnson. You deserve it. Every
damn minute.
Bobby kisses her again, gently pushes her backward, onto the table. Takes one last look at
Leo.
BOBBY
Sorta makes you believe in karma, don't it?
Bobby kisses her more passionately, she returns his kisses with equal fervor. He pulls at her
blouse, she hurries to unbutton his shirt. But then, she can't help it, Shelly turns to glance at
Leo.
Leo remains inert. But the angle, Shelly's guilty conscience, perhaps a flare of light off the Ray
Bans, all conspire to suggest movement, some imperceptible shift in Leo's posture.
Shelly SCREAMS. Rolls out from under Bobby.
BOBBY
What? What?
SHELLY
He moved. I saw him move.
(he reaches or he she pulls away)
No. It's too creepy. It's wrong, Bobby.
Bobby looks from Shelly to Leo. Walks to him.
BOBBY
Okay, Shel. Maybe you're right. I mean I don't wanna
exploit him or nothing.
Bobby carefully removes the party hat, the shades. And the kazoo from Leo's mouth.
BOBBY
Sorry, Leo. We sorta lost control. No need to make
your rehabilitation any more difficult than it already is.
Doc Hayward says you need 'familiar stimulus', so we
just figured, what the hell ... kazoos.
Bobby scoots Leo a little closer to the dinner table, the cake before him, continues, soothes:
BOBBY
Honest, Leo, Shelly and me are gonna do everything we
can to keep you safe and happy.
(new idea)
You want some cake or somethin'? That'd be nice, huh?
With ice cream?
Bobby spoons a big scoop onto the cake as he speaks. Leo does a header into the cake and
cream. Shelly gasps.
SHELLY
Bobby!
Bobby pulls Leo's face out of the cake, returns him to a sitting position. Turns to Shelly.
BOBBY
Gee, you gotta be more careful, Leo. Good thing we
didn't light the candles.
A beat. Then, she can't help it... Shelly begins to laugh.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
Gordon Cole sits on a bench in the station foyer. He glances at his watch. Adjusts his
hearing aids, as if to balance the volume from left to right. Cooper and Truman enter.
COLE
AGENT DALE COOPER!
COOPER
Hello, Gordon. Hope you haven't been waiting too long.
COLE
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE YOU HERE FOR
THE BETTER PART OF THE AFTERNOON.
COOPER
What can I do for you?
COLE
NO MATTER WHATSOEVER. NO APOLOGY
NECESSARY. GOT TO MEET THE LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT TEAM. A GREAT BUNCH.
(YOU REMIND ME OF A LITTLE MEXICAN
CHIHUAHUA TODAY)
Truman nods thanks. Cole continues, as sotto voce as he can manage:
COLE
CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU IN PRIVATE?
COOPER
Of course. Harry, may we use your office?
TRUMAN
Go right ahead.




 
COLE
HOW ABOUT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE?
Cooper leads Gordon Cole inside.
CUT TO:
 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Gordon Cole and Cooper enter.
COLE
I BELIEVE IN SECRECY, COOP. I'LL MAKE
THIS FAST. I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THIS IN
FRONT OF THE MEN.
CUT TO:
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
Truman and Hawk stand in the hall. They can, of course, hear every booming word.
COLE'S VOICE
IT'S ALBERT'S OPINION YOU MIGHT BE
GETTING IN OVER YOUR HEAD AGAIN.
THAT WORRIES ME, COOPER I FEEL A
CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY ...
CUT TO:
 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Back to scene.
COOPER
Gordon, Albert's wrong.
COLE
YOU WENT INTO THE CHUTE IN
PITTSBURGH, COOP. I WANT TO MAKE
DOUBLY SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
AGAIN. COPY?
COOPER
Pittsburgh was a completely different story.
Cole stares at Cooper, obviously having missed what Cooper said. Cooper repeats, this time
with appropriate volume.
COOPER
I WAS WOUNDED IN PITTSBURGH BUT
OTHER THAN THAT THE CASE BEARS NO
COOPER 
SIMILARITIES.
COLE
I MUST SAY YOU LOOK ALL RIGHT. CIRCLES
UNDER YOUR EYES, YOU COULD CATCH UP
ON YOUR SLEEP, BUT THAT PRETTY MUCH
COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.
Cooper holds up a hand to stop the verbal torrent. Cole stops, unfazed. Now completely
focused on his subordinate.
COOPER
GORDON, I AM TIRED. THERE IS A GREAT
DEAL OF WORK TO DO. BUT MY MIND, BODY,
AND SPIRIT ARE UP TO THE TASK.
WITHOUT A DOUBT. EVERYTHING IS AOKAY.
Cole gives Cooper a hearty thumbs up. Cooper responds in kind. Cole withdraws an
envelope from his jacket pocket. Truman enters.
TRUMAN
Coop, just thought you ought to know we can hear
everything you're saying out there.
COOPER
Thanks, Harry.
COLE
(re envelope)
ANONYMOUS MESSAGE. SENT TO HOME
BASE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT, COOP.
LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR, DOESN'T IT?
Cooper opens the envelope. A small piece of paper falls into view. Cooper examines it. It
reads: P to K- Cole studies it over Cooper's shoulder.
COLE
IT'S A CHESS DEAL.
COOPER
An opening move. From Windom Earle.
(a look at Cole)

 INT. BEN HORN'S OFFICE - GREAT NORTHERN' - NIGHT
Ben Horne paces while LELAND PALMER sits like a puppy watching him.
BEN
I can't be too specific, Leland, but with Jerry on the road
I need you back here. Let's just say I have a much better
sense of what you've been through in the last few weeks.
LELAND
I appreciate that, Ben. And I appreciate the confidence.
Really I do.
BEN
If it weren't for your indictment, I could drop you into
your old slot. Our friendship, our history together. But
first I need to know you're okay.
LELAND
I am 100%. 110%. Let me prove it to you.
BEN
(jumping right in)
We've taken a payment from the Icelanders on
Ghostwood, but a group from the Orient wants in in the
worst way. Jerry's on his way to Tokyo to check them
out. I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner. We need to
buy a little time here.
LELAND
First thing we do is re-survey the land. Required because
of the fire. Set up a parade of inspectors, federal, state,
and county 'til Jerry comes back with a full report. If
there is money coming from either direction, we run it
thru the Caymans, pick up some pocket money on the
exchange rate. And if we have to we can drop escrow
into a black hole for six months.
BEN
(beaming)
That's my Leland.
The phone RINGS, Ben answers it. Tojomura is waiting for him in the hotel bar. While Ben
is occupied, Leland slips over to the bookshelf, a stuffed white fox displayed there. Leland
surreptitiously removes a clump of hair from the stuffed animal, secrets it in his coat pocket.
CUT TO:



 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
Truman hurries into the room, nearly bumps into Jonathan, the Asian man who is loaded
down with Josie's luggage. Josie comes out the door from the office, carries luggage as well.
Truman tries to read what is happening off of Josie's face.
TRUMAN
Josie?
JOSIE
Harry, I don't believe you have met my assistant, Mr.
Lee.
JONATHAN
(Asian accent)
Pleased to meet you.
(to Josie)
I'll take these to car.
He nods to Truman and exits with the luggage.
TRUMAN
What are you doing?
JOSIE
I'm going away.
Pause. She moves away from him.
TRUMAN
Where? Why?
JOSIE
I always called you from here. It was here I could talk to
you and be everything you wanted me to be.
TRUMAN
(more firmly)
Where are you going?
JOSIE
I sold the mill. It's over. I'm going home.
TRUMAN
No.
Truman grabs Josie, kisses her. She almost loses herself, then pulls away.
JOSIE
I'm sorry, Don't think badly of me.




 
Jonathan appears in the doorway.
TRUMAN
You can't leave.
JOSIE
Are you speaking as the police?
TRUMAN
I ... I don't know.
JOSIE
It would be best if you ... forget about me.
Josie picks up her bag. Starts to follows Lee out the door.
TRUMAN
I love you.
Josie stops. Truman is down to nothing.
TRUMAN 
I love you, Josie.
She eixts.

Ben Horne and Tojamura take a seat in the lounge after dinner.
BEN
Mr. Tojamura, how about a nitecap?
TOJAMURA
Soda water, please.
(turns to him)
Mr. Horne, allow me to be artless. You have my cashiers
check for five million. I have nothing. Why?
BEN
I know so little about you, Mr. Tojamura and this is a
BEN 
small community. I'm being careful. Trying to be
sensitive to local concerns. You have to understand the
impact this project will have on the community
TOJOMURA
You waste my time. We shall withdraw.
BEN

Oh, no. Please, Mr. Tojomura. Consider the position
I'm in. The mill fire has created a raft of unforeseen
problems, psychic as well as financial. It is my duty as
a civic leader to foster the healing process, even at the
temporary expense of my larger business opportunities.
But I assure you TOJOMURA
(curt)
I know a little about fire. My family was at Nagasaki.
BEN
(without a trace of true feeling)
And what a tragedy it was. Horrifying.
From across the room, loud piano playing stops their conversation. They hear a singer.
LELAND'S VOICE
"I'm wild again. Beguiled again. A simpering,
whimpering child again. Bewitched, bothered, and
bewildered, Am I."
Ben spots Leland across the lounge, singing to TRUDY'S accompaniment.
BEN
Excuse me a moment.
LELAND
(etc.)
"Lost my heart, but what of it..."
Leland moves through the bewildered guests, holding his mic. He stops at a table with an
ELDERLY COUPLE.
LELAND
And where might you folks be from? Twin Peaks? Hey,
that's great, and how about those Steeplejacks, huh?

Leland finishes the song. Police applause.
LELAND
Thank you. Great Northern audiences are the greatest
audiences in the world.
Ben puts a hand on Leland's shoulder and guides him behind the piano.
BEN
Give it a rest, Leland.
(covers the mic)
Temporary insanity, eh, Leland? Let's hope some of
your jury's out there, you're home free.
Tojomura sits at the bar watching. Finds himself sitting next to PETE MARTELL. Pete
smiles at him.
PETE
(re song, with a nod toward Leland)
"Pal Joey." You like musicals?
TOJOMURA
No.
PETE
Not even "Fiddler On the Roof?" Always makes me
weep like a baby.
TOJOMURA
I find the adherence to fantasy troubling and
unreasonable.
PETE
(pondering for an instant)
Yeah, well ...
(clinging to his own oddball beliefs)
Fiddler is something special.
(beat)
You're not from around here, are you?
TOJOMURA
I am a visitor.
PETE
Can I buy you a sake?
TOJOMURA
No thank you.

 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
Mike the One-Armed Man sits in a chair, swears and fidgets. Cooper, Truman, Gordon Cole,
and Hawk stand about him.
MIKE
Please give me my medicine. I can feel the change.
TRUMAN
What change?
COOPER
The drug in your possession contains trace elements
usually found in Haloperidol. Do you suffer from
schizophrenia? Multiple personalities?
MIKE
It's too late ...
Cooper shows Mike the flyer picture of the Long-Haired Man.
COOPER
You know this man, don't you? Why did you lie to me
the first time I questioned you?
MIKE
It wasn't me. Don't you understand? It wasn't me?!!
Mike looks dreadful. Cooper turns to Truman.
COOPER
Give him the drug.
TRUMAN
But ...
COOPER
Now.
Cooper turns back to Mike. Reacts. Truman and Hawk SEE what he sees. They freeze. And
Mike the One-Armed Man begins a TRANSFORMATION. Mike fights it at first, he
arches in his chair as if to fend off some invading spirit. But then his body relaxes completely,
his arms fall to the side. Mike's features shift, a shadow passes into his eyes. His head, once
bowed, now raises up; he looks Cooper squarely in the eyes.
MIKE
There is no need for medicine. I am not in pain.
COOPER
Who are you?
MIKE
My name is Mike.
COOPER
What are you?
MIKE
I am an inhabiting spirit.
COOPER
Who is Phillip Gerard?
MIKE
He is host to me.
COOPER
You spoke to me in my dream. Do you remember?
(a neutral response)
Do you know "Bob?"
MIKE
He ... was my familiar.
COOPER
(after a beat)
Where does Bob come from?
MIKE
There are indications that we come from another world.
Truman and Hawk exchange a glance. They don't believe a word.
COOPER
What does Bob want?
MIKE
He is Bob, eager for fun. He wears a smile, everybody
run.
(smiles)
Do you understand the parasite? It attaches itself to a life
form and feeds. Bob requires a human host. He feeds on
fear and life force. I am like Bob. I was once his partner.
COOPER
(quoting his dream)
"Through the darkness of future past the magician longs
to see ..."
MIKE
(he completes it)
"... one chants out between two worlds, fire, walk with
me ..."
(beat)
But then I saw the Face of God and was purified. I cut
off my arm. And remained close to this vessel.
Inhabiting from time to time for a single purpose.
COOPER
To find Bob.
MIKE
To stop him.
(points to the flyer in Cooper's hand)
This is his true face. Few can see it. The gifted and the
damned.
COOPER
Is he near? Is Bob near us now?
MIKE
For nearly forty years.
COOPER
Where?
MIKE
A large house made of wood. Surrounded by trees. The
house is filled with many rooms, each alike. But they are
occupied by different souls. Night after night.
Truman and Hawk have no idea what the man is talking about. Cooper does.
COOPER
The Great Northern Hotel.

Bob never lingers after death.
COOPER

GERARD

Bob has not visited here.







Truman rolls his eyes. Cooper nods to the Paramedics; they wheel Smith out. Gerard,
unsteady on his feet, seeks refuge in a chair. Truman takes Cooper quietly aside.
TRUMAN
Think this is a good idea, in front of the men and all?
COOPER
Harry, we're at the chicken-soup stage of this crime.
TRUMAN
How's that?
COOPER
"It couldn't hurt."

That's something people say back in Philadelphia.
Truman produces Smith's wallet.
TRUMAN
We're trying to get ahold of Jacoby in Hawaii; Smith

TRUMAN
He was a class "A" nutball, that much seems clear.

Wouldn't hurt for Jacoby to get a gander at this guy
either.
(a second glance)
Looks a little green around the gills.
COOPER
It's not easy being "Mike."

Would you like some coffee, "Mike"?
Gerard shakes his head. Hawk unearths something from the large paper scrap pile, moves

system he's in the middle of installing throughout the station.
CLOSE on a couple of steaming cups of coffee as they're carried into the conference room,
where Truman and Cooper, are seated at the table. Wearing surgical gloves, Cooper is
paging through the diary they found at Harold Smith's. Open beside him is the original diary
they found in Laura's room. Cooper compares the two, takes a sip of coffee.
COOPER
This is Laura's handwriting.
TRUMAN
Why would she keep two diaries?
COOPER
The one we found earlier was a record of events on the
surface. This one apparently tells the story of her inner
life.
TRUMAN
The answer may be in there.
COOPER
Undoubtedly. It's a shame. Mr. Smith saw fit to
mutilate about 45% of the contents.
Hawk enters, carrying an envidence bag containing some torn scraps of paper.
HAWK
This what you're looking for?







COOPER
Precisely.
Cooper opens the bag, takes out the scraps and examines them with a magnifying glass,
comparing them to the second diary.
TRUMAN
(to Hawk)
Those are the scraps you found near the railroad car.
Hawk nods.
COOPER
Yes. Yes. This is where the scraps came from.
(opens the book towards the end)
Look at this.
He points to a section torn out near the end of the book.
TRUMAN
Smith ready did a job on this thing.
COOPER
No, look at the way the pages are torn clean, ripped out
at the roots. Smith ripped and slashed his way through,
like the others we found in his apartment.
(a closer detail)
And look at the edges here at the back; yellowed and
curled. Nine pages. They were taken some time ago.
TRUMAN
By Smith?
COOPER
By the killer. The day she died.
Truman takes the book to examine it.
TRUMAN

The heel comes off. Bobby picks up the contents of the secret compartment: a small, micro
cassette.

A DEPUTY carries a plate of doughnuts and coffee to the conference room. Mr. Zipper, the
plumber, bags one of the doughnuts as the Deputy passes by and enters the conference
room, closing the door behind him. Hawk and Truman watch.
HAWK
That's the third plate of doughnuts Cooper's asked for.




 
TRUMAN
He says he's not coming up for air until he's cracked
what's in that diary.
PETE MARTELL enters the station, spots Harry.
TRUMAN 
Hey, Pete.
PETE
(gravely)
Harry, could we repair to a quiet place for a moment?
TRUMAN
Come on into the office.
PETE
I won't take up too much of your time.
TRUMAN
No trouble at all.
They move into Truman's office.

Pete enters, Truman closes the door.
TRUMAN
What's up?
PETE
Harry, Josie's gone.
TRUMAN
I know. I saw her last night.
PETE
(sad and lonely)
I came back from the late shift. She left a note on the
kitchen table. No goodbyes. No explanation. A note.
TRUMAN
She sold the mill to Ben Horne.
PETE
I signed Catherine's stake over to her a couple days ago.
I didn't think she was going to do it so quickly.




 
Harry puts a sympathetic hand on her shoulder.
PETE 
I've lost 'em both. Not that Josie was ever mine to lose.
TRUMAN
You don't have to explain.
PETE
I loved her. There, I said it. No offense, Harry.
TRUMAN
I loved her, too. I stood there and watched her go.
Watched her assistant carry out her bags.
Pause. Something breaks through Pete's melancholic haze.
PETE
Assistant?
TRUMAN
Asian fella. Never seen him before. Woo?
PETE
What'd he look like?
TRUMAN
Average height. Medium build. Pony tail.
PETE
That was her cousin. Jonathan.
TRUMAN
She said he was her assistant. British accent PETE
This guy could barely speak English.
TRUMAN
(knows in his heart)
Pete, this was the same guy.
PETE
Harry, I've got a bad feeling.
TRUMAN
I'm right there with you.
Pause.

 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Remanants of Laura's diary are spread out over the entire conference table. Cooper
examines the remaining intact pages in the book, making notes, using a magnifying glass and
what scraps he has in front of him to try and reconstruct the contents. He steps away from
the table, picks up a cup of coffe and his microrecorder.
COOPER
(tired and intense)
Diane, it's 5:45 pm, I'm in the conference room with the
remains of Laura Palmer's diary. A great deal of it has
been destroyed, many of Laura's secrets along with it.
Much of what I've been able to decipher supports the
contention of the one-armed man; there are repeated
references to "Bob". He was a threatening presence in her
life from early adolescence. There are intimations of
abuse, molestation. On a regular basis. He is referred
to, on more than one occasion, as a friend of her father's.
And I've just uncovered this entry, dated less than two
weeks before her death.
(reads from diary)
"One of these days I'm going to tell the world about
Ben Horne. I'm going to tell the world who Ben Horne
really is."
The door swings open. Audrey Horne is standing in the doorway.
COOPER 
Audrey ...
Cooper turns off the tape recorder. Audrey enters, closes the door behind her.
AUDREY
I had to see you, I'm sorry COOPER
Are you all right?
She waves off the question. Something much larger looming over her. Trying to bear up
under its weight.
AUDREY
I spoke with my father.
COOPER
Okay.
AUDREY
He was sleeping with her. With Laura. I don't know for
how long. Maybe quite a while.




 
COOPER
(quiet, soothing)
Okay.
AUDREY
She was up at One-Eyed Jack's. Working there. My
father owns the place. That's what I found out.
COOPER
Are you sure?
AUDREY
Yes.
(pause, composes herself)
And Laura knew it too. Laura knew it too.
Pause. Cooper moves to the door.
AUDREY 
What are you gonna do?
COOPER
(opens the door)
Harry?
AUDREY
What are you gonna do?
Cooper takes her by the shoulders.
COOPER
(quietly)
I don't want you to have to testify. I'm going to try to
see that that doesn't happen.
AUDREY
(crumbling)
What are you gonna do?
COOPER
Don't say a word to anyone. Go home. Stay in your
room. I'll try to come see you later. Don't answer the
phone Truman appears in the doorway.
AUDREY
You're going, to arrest him.




 (2)
COOPER
Yes.
She gently disengages herself from him, nods. Tries to smile, but the attempt fails.
AUDREY
I've got to tell Johnny.
COOPER
Why don't you do that?
AUDREY
(faint)
Okay.
She moves out like a sleepwalker.
COOPER
(to Truman)
Have somebody drive her back to the hotel.
TRUMAN
What's going on
COOPER
We need a warrant. A warrant for the arrest of Ben
Horne.
They look at each other. Truman nods, grimly, heads out. Cooper looks sadly down at the
remanants of the diary.

Madeleine enters, carrying a couple of packed bags which she sets down, calling back to
someone outside of the room.
MADELEINE
I'm going to leave these down here tonight. I'll be all
ready to get an early start.
Behind her in the alcove, Ben Horne comes down the stairs, stops to look at himself in the
mirror. He smoothes back his hair. We move to notice that the face staring back out of the
mirror is "Bob."
We follow Ben's hand into his pocket. He takes out a pair of rubber surgical gloves and starts
to put them on as he moves toward the living room.
Madeleine has finished fussing over his luggage. She turns and notices Sarah stretched out on
the floor beside the sofa.
MADELEINE
Aunt Sarah? ... Aunt Sarah? ...
As she bends over to look at her, Ben moves in behind her, raising his hands.

A fax is arriving over the fax machine. Ben Horne crouches over the machine, eagerly rips off
the transmission as it's completed. He scans it, smiles and folds it.




 
HORNE
Good news, Mr. Tojamura.
TOJAMURA is seated in the office, his VALET a shadow.
HORNE 
My brother Jerry has spoken with your people in Osaka,
he's checked your references with the Tokyo banks and
the answer to your proposal my good friend is a big
thumbs-up.
TOJAMURA
We appreciate your promptness.
HORNE
(shaking his hand)
Speaking for the entire community of Twin Peaks, I
can't tell you how pleased we are to welcome you into
the Ghostwood fold.
TOJAMURA
Thank you so much.
He snaps his fingers; the Valet produces a thick sheath of contracts.
TOJAMURA
Contracts. For your perusal.
HORNE
And fast approval, I'm sure.
Horne accepts the contracts. A knock at the door. The door opens. Cooper, Truman and
Hawk. Truman walks right in.
HORNE 
Sheriff?
TRUMAN
Mr. Horne, we'd like you to come with us please.
HORNE
Fine, I happen to be in a meeting TRUMAN
(blowing up)
You're wanted for questioning in the murder of Laura
Palmer, is that specific enough for you?
Horne looks from Truman to Cooper.

HORNE
You're insane Tojamura has retreated a few steps. Horne turns to him.
HORNE 
There's been a dreadful mistake.
TRUMAN
Come with us now or would you rather go out through
your lobby in handcuffs.
HORNE
Cooper, what kind of a sick joke is this?
COOPER
You'd better do as he says.
They take him by the arms. Horne struggles, yelling, composure completely gone.
HORNE
No! No! You can't do this! You can't do this!
Truman and Hawk drag him out the door, Cooper follows
Tojamura watches them exit. His eyes are bright. He may be laughing.

Dim light. In his bathrobe and slippers, Pete putters around the kitchen, humming, heating
up a glass of milk. Far off he hears a gust of wind, the sound of a door in the distance. He
looks up, nothing, finishes fixing his milk. Takes the glass, at a last minute grabs a cookie and
heads off. He comes around the corner and nearly screams when he finds himself nearly face
to face with Tojamura.
PETE
Who the heck are you?
Tojamura advances towards him, doesn't say a word.




 
PETE 
(retreating slightly)
How'd you get in here? Hey - hey!
Tojamura grabs him and kisses him. Pete drops the glass of milk to the floor. Pete struggles.
Tojamura pulls back from the embrace. Pete frantically tries to wipe off his lips.
TOJAMURA
Since the moment we met, I've found myself strangely
attracted to you.
PETE
Mister, you better get out of here TOJAMURA
There's something about your eyes; they're warm and
deep (no trace of an accent; Catherine's voice)
- and blue as the open sky.
PETE
(now he's really confused)
Huh?
TOJAMURA
Pete ... it's me.
(no response; less patient)
It's Catherine, you dummy.
Tojamura takes off his glasses. Pete sees something he recognizes. Tears come to his eyes.
PETE
Oh my God ... you look terrible.

Truman, Cooper and Hawk enter with Ben Horne. The Log Lady is waiting in the reception

Hawk and Horne move off. Cooper moves to the Log Lady, Truman follows.
LOG LADY
(quiet, intense)
You must go to the Roadhouse. Everything points that
way.




 
COOPER
Why?
LOG LADY
(a gesture to her log)
It won't say. But it insists.
Cooper looks at Truman.
TRUMAN
We can't question Horne 'til his lawyer gets here; he's
flying back from Japan, won't be here 'til morning. I
could use a beer myself.
COOPER

All right.

 INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
A band is playing on stage. DONNA HAYWARD enters. She looks for and finds where
James is seated, his back to her, reading.
DONNA
You heard about Harold Smith?
JAMES
Yeah.
She sits. James sets the book down. They look at each other.
JAMES 
It's not your fault, Donna
DONNA
(hurting)
No?
JAMES
I don't think it's anybody's fault. He was a sick guy.
DONNA
He wasn't bad.
JAMES
You don't think he killed Laura?




 
DONNA
I don't think so. I think he was ... mixed up. I think he
was hurt inside in a way I didn't understand.
JAMES
Everybody's hurt inside. That doesn't mean you can go
around trying to knock somebody's brains out.
DONNA
I think he was defending himself. His life was in that
room, his whole life, and we violated that JAMES
Donna, are you defending him?
DONNA
No. But he didn't kill Laura. Maybe he was sick and
what he did was wrong. But he didn't deserve to die for
it.
JAMES
You better be clear about this; that was his choice. If he
didn't want to live there was nothing you or the police or
anybody could do to change that.
DONNA
(a sad realization)
Kind of like Laura.
JAMES
I guess so.
DONNA
(rueful)
God ... nobody told us life was going to be like this.
James takes her hand.
JAMES
Maybe nobody knew.
They look at each other other, draw some comfort from the thought.
JAMES 
Go for a ride?
She nods. Tears in her eyes. They exit. We pick up and stay with Cooper and Truman as they
enter through another door, move to the bar and order beers. The singer on stage begins a
new song.




 (2)
TRUMAN
What do we do?
COOPER
I don't know. Wait.
They watch the band; it's an emotional song, filled with regret and longing. People lean
forward, drawn in by the song, but also by a mounting, palpable sense of tension and fear in
the air.
Cooper picks up on it, looks at Truman, who feels it as well.
INTERCUT:
 COOPER'S POV - THE STAGE
In mid-song, the band vanishes from the stage; the Giant appears in the center of the stage.
He looks right at Cooper.
GIANT
It's happening again. It's happening again.
Cooper appears to be the only one who sees him. He looks again, unsure of what he's seen.
The Giant fades away, replaced by the band once again, who finish the song.
Cooper sits stock still, shocked by what he's seen. Truman looks at him.
TRUMAN
Cooper? Cooper?
Someone pats Cooper on the shoulder. Cooper looks up. It's the old ROOM SERVICE
WAITER from the Great Northern Hotel. His eyes are filled with tears. He shakes his head,
pats Cooper on the shoulder again and moves off.
Cooper stares straight ahead.
COOPER
He's killed again.

let's one go. The door bell rings. He walks off camera to answer it. It's DONNA and JAMES.
LELAND (O.S.)
Donna, James, come on in ...
They enter the living room
DONNA
We just came by to say goodbye to Maddy.
LELAND
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed her. I dropped her
off at the bus station not twenty minutes ago.

She's gone?
Donna looks, at James, trying to get a read on his reaction.
LELAND
Yes. She thought you were coming by last night.
James and Donna glance at each other.
JAMES
Did she say anything?
LELAND
I'd have to say she was a little disappointed Sarah calls from upstairs.
SARAH (O.S.)
Leland?







He goes halfway up the stairs. Donna and James look at each other.
DONNA
I'm glad we were together last night, and I'm not
sorry we missed her, are you?
JAMES
No.
Leland returns.
LELAND
You could try writing, I'm sure she'd love to hear
from you. Do you have her address?
DONNA
Yes. Sorry to have bothered you.
LELAND
No bother, say hi to your folks for me, Donna.
She nods, Leland walks them to the door and they leave. From off screen ...

There stands VIVIAN SMYTHE, a woman of breeding, with the pearls to prove it. Two steps
behind her is ERNIE NILES, if class were a drive down the middle of a fairway, Ernie pushed
it into the light rough. Close, but no cigar. He carries a cellular phone.
NORMA
(a bit stunned)
Mother?
Norma sets the plate down in front of TOAD. Vivian inspects it.
VIVIAN
I trust those are real potatoes and not flakes.
NORMA
Real potatoes. What a nice ... what a surprise.
Before Toad can take a bite Vivian reaches over, takes a fork from the counter and tests his
potatoes.
VIVIAN
Hmm, very good. I see they taught Henry a skill in
the stockade. Where is your charming husband?
NORMA
Hank's ... not here right now.
VIVIAN
I see.
Vivian starts to walk along the counter, checking out the place.
NORMA
Mother, if you don't mind my asking, what are you
doing here?
VIVIAN
I wanted to introduce you to my husband. Ernie, this
is Norma. Ernie's a financial analyst.
Ernie waves from his cellular phone.
ERNIE
Hi, how are you?
NORMA
Husband...?

VIVIAN
(blithe, secure)
We're honeymooning.
Norma reels just a little. But before she has a chance to question or reply:
ERNIE
Norma, could I trouble you for a cup of coffee?
Norma nods, gets the coffee. Vivian sits at the counter.
VIVIAN
I just love what you've done to your little diner,
Norma. The plastic flowers add such a nice measure
of cheer.
(brushing crumbs off the counter)
And the tablecloths are most attractive.
Norma takes the coffee to Ernie.
ERNIE
Thanks so much - nice to see those good looks
didn't isolate themselves to one generation.
(winks sweetly, then yells in the phone)
No, I need London gold figures, I've got a
trader in Tokyo with petrodollars to burn.
(more trouble with the phone)
Damn... reception's terrible out here.
(line goes dead)
It went "roam" again.
Norma rejoins her mother.
VIVIAN
You still look very smart in that uniform, Norma.
Such a nice figure and you've kept it well.
NORMA
Mother, I don't mean to be rude; how long are you
going to be here?
VIVIAN
In town? A few days. Ernie wanted to spend some
time in the county. Why?
NORMA
I wish you'd let me know you were coming*
VIVIAN
I didn't want you to make a fuss. You know me,
dear, I'm easy. What's wrong?

NORMA
Nothing. There's a food critic coming and I'm a
little short handed, that's all.
VIVIAN
Food critic? Oh, that's why you've tried so hard to
make everything look nice.
Norma takes a shot at a smile, comes up a little short. Ernie's off the phone, comes over, sets
his paper and cup down on the counter.
ERNIE
Norma, looking forward to spending more time
with you. Do they have cellular service in the car.
Vivian, if it's all right with you we should check in,
there's a Tokyo fax wait for me at the desk.
VIVIAN
We'll be at the Northern, dear. Sorry we missed
Henry. I'll call later.
Vivian and Ernie leave. Norma picks up the paper Ernie left behind. Notices that he wasn't
looking at the Dow Jones, but rather the spread sheet from the USA TODAY sports section
where he has circled his choices with a magic marker. We can see "Houston, 3 1/2, take the
points."

Cooper and Truman step through the Great Northern Lobby. Cooper speaks quietly, into his
recorder.
COOPER
Diane... 10:00 a.m. at the Great Northern. I've just
been in a hotel room with the One-armed Man... or
what's left of him. In another time, another culture,
this man would have been a seer, a shaman priest...
possibly a leader. In our world, he's a shoe peddler,
and lives in the shadows.
As he speaks, Cooper notices someone up ahead. He pauses, shuts off the recorder. It's
Leland Palmer.
COOPER
Leland Palmer.
CLOSE on LELAND, holding a golf club, doing a soft shoe routine for a group of entralled
CHEERLEADERS. He slowly slides his foot around in a wide circle. Cooper and Truman
exchange a look. They stop and watch. Leland finishes, the girls applaud. He sees Cooper and
Truman, starts over.


COOPER
Does he know we've arrested Ben Horne?
TRUMAN
Doesn't look like it.
COOPER
Best that he hear it from you.
Harry nods, Leland arrives.


LELAND
Harry, Agent Cooper.
It takes Harry a moment to get it out.
TRUMAN
Leland, we've arrested Ben Horne for Laura's murder.
He hasn't been charged yet, but we're holding him.
LELAND
Ben? There must be some mistake ... I thought
Jacques Renault ...
COOPER
No.
LELAND

Is there a strong case against him?
TRUMAN
(a look at Cooper)
I think so.
LELAND
I see.
Leland seems to be struggling with powerful emotions.
COOPER
Are you all right? Mr. Palmer?
LELAND
(nods, shaken)
The law will handle this.
COOPER
(a mild rebuke)
As it should be.
LELAND

JERRY

The deputy opens the cell door. Jerry hands him a small Japanese flag. Jerry, steps inside. The
deputy closes the door and leaves. The Brothers look at each other for a long moment.
BEN
Jerry ...
JERRY
Ben ...
They suddenly embrace long and hard, then step back.
JERRY 
Ben, since your regular mouthpiece has been charged
with murder himself, I'm going to handle your case
personally. Let's get started: did you kill her?
BEN
(upset)
Jerry!
JERRY
Sorry, you're right, the last thing a good defense
attorney needs to know is the truth.
BEN
Can you get me out?
JERRY
They, can only hold you for 24 hours without
charging you ... or is it 







BEN
Jer, I'm in trouble here!
JERRY
Under control big brother. Okay, so where are we
saying you were the night Laura died?
BEN
I was with Catherine.
JERRY
Not a good choice.
BEN
It happens to be the truth.
JERRY
Oh dear, Any sign of her? Bone fragments, teeth, a
charred corroborating note regarding your
whereabouts?
(Ben shakes his head no)
I'm so depressed.
A dejected Ben sits down on the bottom bunk. Jerry starts to bang his head on the bunk bed.
He suddenly realizes what his head is hitting.
JERRY

Bunk beds.
He jumps up onto the upper bunk, stretches out. Neither says a thing for a moment.
JERRY
Do you remember our first room, Ben?
BEN

Yes ...
JERRY
Me on the top bunk, you on the bottom ... Louise
Dombrowski dancing on the hook rug with the
flashlight ... Lord, what's become of us?
BEN
What is that smell?
Jerry takes an enormous ginger root out of his pocket and hands it down to his brother.
JERRY
Ginger root. I'm supposed to take a bath in it when
I get home. Then dry my right side with my right
hand and my left with my left hand. Cures jet lag.
Little trick I picked up from a Geisha named Meko.
She boiled my shirts. Wish you'd been there, Ben ...

Jerry and Truman look on. Cooper stands back in the room, out of the light.
JERRY
Sheriff, I protest this brutal treatment of my client.
After all this man has done for this town.
Hayward looks at Jerry, jabs the lancet into Ben's Finger, a bit harder than is usual.
BEN
Ow!
Hayward smears blood onto a slide He sticks a cotton ball on Ben's finger.
HAYWARD 
(to Truman and Cooper)
I'll have results in a couple of hours.
Hayward leaves. Jerry tries to take charge.
JERRY

I witnessed such complete and utter disregard for an
accused man's constitutional rights ...
From the corner of the room comes...
COOPER
Jeremy Horne, Gonzaga University 1974, graduated
last in a class of 162, passed bar on the third
attempt, licence to practice revoked in Illinois,
Florida, Alaska

JERRY
Hey, I'm not on trial here.
COOPER
Sit ... down.
Jerry does. From the shadows, Cooper tosses Laura's diary onto the table, then steps into the
light.
COOPER
Do you know what this is, Mr. Horne?
BEN
A ... book.
COOPER
Look at it closely.
He does.
BEN
(cautiously)
A ... diary.
Cooper lays out a playing card - a one-eyed jack. They stare at it.
COOPER
We know all about One Eyed Jacks ... so did Laura.
Cooper picks up the diary, reads from it.
COOPER
"I'm going to tell the world about Ben Horne. I'm
going to tell them who Ben Horne really is."
(puts the diary down)
But she never got the chance, did she?
(pause)
Come on, Ben, we're all grown-ups here ... a wild,
young girl like Laura. Things spin out, of control.
She becomes a threat. Not just to you, your business
... your family.
Ben explodes, stands up shouting.

BEN
You are out of line!
COOPER
Maybe you don't have anything to hide?
(picks up the diary again)
That's not what it says in here BEN
(shouting, out of control)
You can't talk to me like this!
It's all Jerry can do to control his brother.
JERRY
Ben, ssshhh, Ben, let's sit down, nice and easy, right
here.
Truman steps around the table and helps Ben into his chair.
TRUMAN
Sit down, Mr. Horne.
They all try to catch their breath for a moment.
JERRY
Gentlemen, I'd like a moment alone with my
brother, with my client. ... if you don't mind.
Truman looks at Cooper, he nods "Yes".
COOPER
You have your moment.
Cooper picks up the diary, and exits the room with Harry. Jerry rubs Ben's shoulders.
JERRY
Ben, Ben, Ben ... if you're going to blurt out a
confession our options shrink down to a tiny little
nub.
BEN
(dejected)
What do we do?
Jerry walks over and sits across the table from his brother.
JERRY
Your alibi has been roasted, they can establish
motive. And your blood may have Laura's finger
prints on it.
They look at each other, think a moment.
JERRY
Ben, as your attorney, friend and brother ... I strongly
suggest that you get yourself a better lawyer.

Close on a dual cassette deck. As the cassette spins in one deck, we pull back. BOBBY BRIGGS
looms above. He holds a small micro-recorder to the built-in microphone of the cassette
deck. Ben Horne's and Leo's voice's are heard from the micro-recorder.
LEO (TAPE)
Burn the mill?
BEN (TAPE)
Keep it simple. Insurance investigator should read
"arson," block letters, about uh, six feet high.
LEO (TAPE)
The deal we discussed?
BEN (TAPE)
The rest on delivery.
Bobby turns off the dual recorder and his small micro-recorder, his fingers dancing over the
tape decks. He removes the cassette from the deck and lays it on the table.
BOBBY
(to himself)
That's Ben Horne's voice... Ben Horne and Leo ...
think, Bobby.
SHELLY calls from the other room.
SHELLY
(pleading)
Bobby! ...
Bobby picks up a pen and writes a note in big black letters. "I think we should talk." He then
slips one of the cassettes and the note in a large envelope, seals it, gives it a kiss. Bobby turns,
Shelly





 
stands there, covered in baby food. Bobby smiles wickedly, walks over, removes a glob of
food from her neck with a long sensuous lick. Shelly doesn't seem to notice.
SHELLY
He did it again ... it's your turn to clean him this
time.
Bobby cools off. Shelly walks over to the table, fingers the envelope.
SHELLY
What's this?
BOBBY
Our ship.
SHELLY
What?
BOBBY
Since our cash cow in the other room has turned into
a sink hole ...
(slowly advances on her)
I've decided to pursue a career in business.
SHELLY
Really? ... Like a salesman?
BOBBY
I'm thinking management.
Shelly's eyes light up.
SHELLY
Oh, Bobby, that sounds great.
He reaches her, picks her up and sits her on the table.
BOBBY
You're going to have everything you've ever wanted.
Bobby moves in for a kiss.
SHELLY
(excited)
A cloth diaper service.
Bobby freezes: how did I get into this mess, and how do I get out?
CUT TO:

 INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Close on the face of the ONE-ARMED MAN, lying in bed. His eyes are closed, he seems to be
resting comfortably, then begins to twitch. His eyes suddenly open. "Mike" is back. We pull
back, a NURSE, sitting next to the door.
MIKE
(to himself)
He's close ...
The Nurse hears him, puts down her knitting, walks over to him.
MIKE
Could you get me some ice water?
She hesitates a moment, then nods "yes." His eyes follow her as she walks out of the room
and closes the door.
CUT TO:
 INT. HALLWAY - DAY
The Nurse exits the room, walks over to a DEPUTY sitting across the hall from the door. She
tells him she's going for the ice and walks off. The Deputy gets up, walks toward the door.
POV of the Deputy, as he reaches the door, pushes it open, and enters. The bed is empty,
curtains blow in an open window.
Gerard/Mike steps out from the shadows behind the door. We pull back as he raises a blunt
instrument in the air and brings it down on the unsuspecting Deputy's head. Voices are heard
in the hallway, Mike turns, looks toward the open window.
We move in, the curtains blow wildly in a gust of wind, as the Nurse's scream echoes
through the Great Northern.
FADE TO BLACK.

 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
HANK JENNINGS enters the diner, stops when he sees Norma behind the cash register.
HANK
(tries to bluster his way through it)
Hi, Norma. Guess I'm a little late.
NORMA
48 hours is not late, Hank, it's missing.
He grabs an apron, starts to put it on as he sweet talks her.
HANK
Sorry, I had some business I had to take care of.
NORMA
Business? No, this is a business Hank. A business is
where you go every day whether you feel like it or
not.
HANK
(reaching for her)
Norma NORMA
Save the sweet talk. I am this far from telling you
to take a hike.





 
HANK
(dripping with sincerity)
Please. Please don't make that kind of judgment
without hearing me out.
She looks at him, still seething. He sees a crack of daylight.
HANK 
Norma, because of the bad choices I made, there are
people out there, people from my past, who want to
see me fail. I've tried fighting them. That just got
me in more trouble. I've tried running, but there's
always someone faster. I know it's no way for a man
to live his life, bur sometimes it's best just to hole up
and wait for the storm to pass. I didn't mean to hurt
you, I'm just trying to keep my head above water ...
NORMA
Maybe next time, you should ask for help.
They look at each other for a moment.
HANK
Next time I will.
Norma smiles. Hank turns, comes face to face with Norma's Mother.
VIVIAN
So, the prodigal son returns.
HANK
(not loosing a stride)
Vivian. You ... look ... great.
VIVIAN
(not fooled for a second)
Prison treat you well?
HANK
That's a long story.
VIVIAN
Why don't we hear it over dinner tonight? The Great
Northern, say ... eight-thirty.
HANK
We'd love to.

NORMA
I don't know if I can get away.
HANK
It'll be fine, honey, we'll be there, eight-thirty sharp.
Vivian smiles, looks at Hank, exits. Norma gives Hank a look.
HANK 
Hey, she's family, Norma.
Norma walks to the kitchen. We move in on Hank, the wheels turning.

 EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Establish.
CUT TO:
 INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
CLOSE ON Truman, looking intently out the window through binoculars. A beat. A throat
is cleared behind him at the office door. It's PETE MARTELL. A little uncertain, hat in hand.
PETE
Harry?
TRUMAN
(gazing through binoculars)
Hello, Pete.
PETE
(stepping closer, re binoculars)
Whatcha got?
TRUMAN
Woodpecker. Pillared, I think.
PETE
(with a smile)
A Pillared Woodpecker. Outstanding.
(beat)
Harry...?
Truman turns from the window, sets the binoculars upon his desk.

TRUMAN
What's up?
PETE
(after a beat, kneading hat in hands)
Josie's gone.
TRUMAN
I know.
PETE
(sad and lonely)
I came back from the late shift. She left a note on the
kitchen table. No goodbyes. No explanation. A note.
TRUMAN
She sold the mill to Ben Horne.
PETE
(thinking of Catherine's rebirth)
Well, not exactly...
TRUMAN
You don't have to explain.
PETE
(mind wandering back to Josie)
I loved her. There, I said it. No offense, Harry.
TRUMAN
I loved her too. I stood there and watched her go.
Watched her assistant carry out her bags.
PETE
(the fog clears)
Assistant?
TRUMAN
Asian fella. Never seen him before? Lee?
PETE
What'd he look like?
TRUMAN
Average height. Medium build. Pony tail.
PETE
That was her cousin. Jonathan.
TRUMAN
She said he was her assistant. British accent PETE
This guy could barely speak English.
TRUMAN
(knows in his heart)
Pete, this was the same guy.
PETE
Harry, I've got a bad feeling.
TRUMAN
I'm right there with you.
Just then: the door opens, Cooper hurries into the room.
COOPER
Harry!
(beat)
Gerard's escaped from the hotel.
TRUMAN
(man of action)
You'll have to excuse me, Pete.
(to Cooper, crossing to retrieve jacket)
I'll put out an all points.
COOPER
He won't get far. If he does, maybe he'll lead us to
"Bob."
Cooper and Truman make a hasty, exit. Pete remains behind, forgotten. A beat. He reaches
into his jacket pocket, pulls out a small tape recorder. Then, steeling himself for what is to
come:
PETE
Ben Horne...
CUT TO:
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Cooper and Truman bolt out of Harry's office and exit the station. A moment later Andy
walks in and comes face to face with Lucy, carrying her sister's baby. Neither says a word for
a moment, Andy can't take his eyes off of the child.
ANDY
(stunned)
Lucy ...
LUCY
What?
Andy's eyes widen, then he passes out cold. The baby breaks into a wild fit of crying.
CUT TO:
 INT. JAIL - DAY
The door to the cell area is opened, PETE MARTELL peeks his head in and looks around,
clearly not comfortable in a place so devoid of wood. He cautiously steps inside. Ben's been
watching.
BEN
Step right in Pete. We desperate criminal's are all
safely locked in our cages.
Pete walks over, tests the door to the cell, makes sure it's locked.
PETE
I have a message for you.
BEN
Ah, greetings From the boys down at the mill?
Pete grunts his disapproval, then takes a small cassette player out of a pocket in his jacket.
This sparks Ben's interest, though he won't show it.
BEN 
But first, a little music ...
He starts to turn away, Pete turns on the tape.
CATHERINE'S VOICE (TAPE)
Hello, Benjamin ...
Ben freezes, then swings around, too stunned to speak.
CATHERINE (TAPE)
Cat got your tongue?
Ben looks at Pete, who smiles.
CATHERINE (TAPE)
Sorry I haven't dropped by for a visit, dear, but I
have a strong aversion to prisons.
BEN
(a realization)
She's alive.
CATHERINE (TAPE)
Benjamin, darling, you don't look too well, why
don't you sit down?
He does.
CATHERINE (TAPE)
How often I've thought of you. You and that night
we spent together lost in love ... when was that? Yes,
I remember, it was the night Laura Palmer died. It
seems so long ago, almost like a dream. Memory's
so unreliable finally, maybe it was a dream, maybe
it never happened. To tell you the truth, I can't be
sure anymore.
Ben springs out of the bunk over to the bars.
BEN
What does she want? I'll pay it ... anything.
Pete chuckles.
CATHERINE (TAPE)
In exchange for my testimony, you will sign the mill
and Ghostwood estates back over to me. I will
consider letting you keep your precious hotel.
  (2)
PETE
You okay there, Benjy?
Ben's pale as a sheet.
CATHERINE (TAPE)
A representative of mine will come to you with the
documents within 24 hours If you won't cooperate,
I'm confident you'll go on from here to excel at one
of the many fine career opportunities offered by the
federal prison system. Ben, so nice to see you again.
PETE
(chuckling)
That Catherine ...
BEN
(stunned)
She set me up. She set me up.
PETE
She's a caution, isn't she?
Pete leaves. We move in on Ben, a slow burn. He turns around, grabs a pillow from the bed,
wildly attacks the bars with it.
BEN
(out of control, a frightening violent rage)
No!... no .... no ... no ... no ... no ... nooooo!
We pull back, feathers floating everywhere. Ben stands in the middle of it. Lost for the first
time in his life.
CUT TO:
 EXT. ROAD - DAY
Big Ed Hurley's pickup truck swerves wildly down the middle of a country road.
CUT TO:
 INT. TRUMAN'S BRONCO DAY
Cooper sees the oncoming car in their lane before Harry.
COOPER
Are driver education programs compulsory in your
school system?
Harry has seen it, nods "yes."
TRUMAN
Yep ...
COOPER
Think we've got a drop out. Look out, Harry!
The truck doesn't pull over, Harry drives off the road. They're startled, but neither they or
the car are damaged. They look at each other a moment. Did they see who they think they
saw?
COOPER
Big, Ed?
CUT TO:
 INT. CAR - DAY
Close on Big Ed behind the wheel.

The sheriff approaches from behind, lights and siren blaring. Ed smiles, waves to them, obeys
their instructions to pull over to the side of the road.
CUT TO:
 ROAD - DAY
Truman and Cooper step out of the Bronco, as does Ed out of his truck.
ED
(concerned)
Harry, Agent Cooper, are you all right?
TRUMAN
We're fine, Ed, you?
ED
I'm fine. I was, was just on my way out to the club
to break in out some new irons. Boron. Graphite
shafts. I started thinking about Laura. I guess my
mind wandered.
COOPER
It's a good practice to leave your troubles behind

COOPER 
when you sit behind the wheel of a vehicle.
ED
Yes, of course, you're quite right. My apologies.
Truman and Cooper are ready to leave it there.
ED
Oh. Oh, I did remember something. As you'd
asked? The night Laura died. I was working late at
the station. Around ten. Ben Horne shows up in his
fancy car. He looks real agitated, talking to
himself. I heard him say something about a 'dairy.'
TRUMAN
A dairy?
ED
Yes, I think so.
COOPER
A diary?
ED
(thinks)
That might've been it.
Ed notices that Cooper is looking at the back of his pickup. Truman's radio crackles with a
call. He goes to answer it.
ED
Are you a golfer, Agent Cooper?
COOPER
Yes. I enjoy its precision.
ED
(smiles)
May I show you my new clubs?
Ed walks over to the back of his pickup. Ed picks up a club, as if it were a weapon, turns, and
starts toward Cooper. Truman steps out of the Bronco.
TRUMAN
They found Gerard, near the waterfall.
COOPER
Let's go get him.

He turns to Ed, who abruptly stops.
COOPER 
Ed, afraid I'll hive to take a look at those clubs
another time.
ED
I understand. Anything I can do to help, please let
me know.
COOPER
(studies him for a moment)
We will..
Cooper and Truman get in the Bronco and drive off. Ed watches them, then begins to laugh
wickedly as he walks back-to the rear, throws the club inside.
He climbs in behind the wheel, looks in the rear view mirror. It's "Bob."

ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY



Hawk walks through the station doors escorting Gerard, who's one arm is handcuffed to his
belt. As they pass the reception area we pick up Lucy putting a cold compress on Andy's
forehead. Her sister sits next to them holding the baby, keeping up a running dialogue.
GWEN
- the same thing used to happen to me when I first
got pregnant, I'd be out shopping, and boom, pass
right out in the produce section, then come to
covered with bruises and crushed fruit and strangers
standing over waiting to see if I was dead; people
want terrible things to happen to you, I know Andy, who's been attempting to follow the story stares at Gwen for a moment, then turns to
Lucy.
ANDY
I want to talk to you about my sperms.
GWEN
Sperms, that's all men think about; I remember when
Little Kal was born they laid him on my breast
I looked down and saw what kind of a tiny creature
we were dealing with and I thought, good god, just
what the world doesn't need, another sperm
running around loose, women beware.
They both stare at her.
GWEN 
Well I did.
ANDY
(to Lucy)
I had mine counted. Twice. The first time they
were all dead.
GWEN
If I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
ANDY
The second time they were jumping like salmon
swimming upstream.
GWEN
So of course all you could think of was spawning.




 
They both turn to Gwen.
ANDY/LUCY
Shut up!
She moves away. Andy and Lucy turn to each other.
ANDY
So when you told me that you were pregnant I didn't
think it could be me because mine were all dead
supposedly at the time.
LUCY
Uh-huh.
ANDY
But they got better. I was misinformed.
(beaming)
I'm the father.
LUCY
(knows it's more complicated)
Oh brother ...
ANDY
(starting to crestfall)
Aren't I?
They look at each other. Lucy puts her head in her hands.
CUT TO:
 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
Ben Horne stands in the middle of the dimly light room. The One-Armed Man slowly circling
him like a blood hound. Cooper, Truman and Jerry Horne are also in the room. Gerard
stops, pale and weak turns away from Ben, sits, speaks softly to Cooper and Truman.
GERARD
He has been close ... Bob is not here now ...
Jerry moves to them.
JERRY
Sheriff, isn't there something you'd like to share
With us?
Gerard stares at him.




 
JERRY 
And would you please ask this guy to stop staring at
me like I'm a dog biscuit?
Gerard wipes his forehead, growing weaker.
GERARD
Bob has been very close.
JERRY
Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob.
(to Ben)
Do we know a Bob?
(grandstanding)
Sheriff, no offense, but clearly this man's stairs don't
reach all the way to the attic. Now your 24 hours are
up; you either charge my client or let him.
Hawk walks into the room, hands Truman a note. He reads it then hands it to Cooper.
Truman walks over and leans on the table, glares at Ben.
TRUMAN
I'm charging you with the murder of Laura Palmer.
BEN
Good move, Jerry.
GERARD
No, no ...
TRUMAN
Hawk, take Mr. Gerard back to the hotel. Nail the
windows shut, I want two men on his door
Hawk takes Gerard and escorts him out.
GERARD
No ... no ...
They leave. Ben cooly eyes Truman.
BEN
You two bit lumberjack, you're finished in this town!
COOPER
(with authority)
Be quiet!
Everyone is. Cooper looks at Harry and smiles.
COOPER
Harry, I think we better talk outside.
Truman hesitates, finally nods yes, and walks out, followed by Cooper. Jerry starts to rub
Ben's shoulder's, speaking softly in warm soothing tones.
CUT TO:
 INT. DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman step into the corridor.
COOPER
Harry, I think we're saddling the horse here before
we're ready to ride.
TRUMAN
I don't follow.
COOPER
I don't think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer.
TRUMAN
What?
COOPER
We should release him.
TRUMAN
(very frustrated)
Coop, look, I've tried to help you every step of the
way, I've stood by you. But I have had just about
enough of giants, dwarfs, dreams and throwing rocks
at Tibetan milk bottles. Somebody does a crime,
it's my job to lock 'em up. And I cannot in good
conscience let a man walk from my jail who I think
is a killer! I can't do it.
Cooper looks at Harry, smiles.
COOPER
You're right. This is your backyard. Sometimes an
outsider can forget that.
Cooper pats Harry on the arm. Walks away. We move in on Truman, wondering how and
why he won that battle so easily.

 EXT. GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT
Establish.
CUT TO:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Close on Hank, gnawing on a huge beef rib, staring at Ernie. Vivian takes a bite of her
salmon, tastes it carefully.
VIVIAN
Firm ... fresh ... just a little overcooked.
ERNIE
Mine too.
Hank smiles, barbecue sauce on his chin.
HANK
Just right.
Norma stands. The evening is not going well.
NORMA
Will you excuse me for a moment?
VIVIAN
I'll join you.
Ernie stands as they leave. Hank hurriedly rises as well, wiping off his chin.
ERNIE
Ladies ... hurry back.
They leave. Ernie stands for a moment then sits back down. Hank sets down the rib. They
study each other for a moment.
ERNIE 
You're not going to say anything, are you? If Vivian
ever found out I was "inside," she'd leave me flat.
Hank begins to chuckle.
HANK
Ernie Niles. Ernie "The Professor" Niles.
ERNIE
So... when .. did you ...?

HANK
Couple weeks. But let me tell you Ernie, without
you to pal around with, those last six months were
sheer hell. Nobody to go to the library with...
nobody to stamp license plates with...
Hank puts a hand on Ernie's shoulder, gives him a rough shake. Ernie tries to smile, but
Hank clearly makes him nervous.
HANK
So what's the angle here with Miss Moneybags,
anyway?
ERNIE
There's no angle.
HANK
Come on, buddy, we never had any secrets. Vivian's
rolling in dough.
ERNIE
Vivian and I met at a Republican fundraiser. We're
married.
HANK
(admiring)
You musta told her some tall tale. A whopper.
ERNIE
I am trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth
these days. It's therapeutic.
(as if to prove the benefit)
Vivian wants me to handle all her investments.
HANK
What about yours? You gonna introduce her to your
loansharks?
ERNIE
I'm out of it, Hank. I don't gamble anymore. I go
to meetings. I go to church, too.
HANK
So does Vivian know you ran off with the
congregation's picnic fund?
ERNIE
(waffling)
I would never steal from a church. It was a savings
and loan. I was sick, it was an illness and I've paid
my debt. It's a new life. A clean slate.


HANK
So she doesn't know.
(Ernie's look confirms it)
You know, Ernie, this is interesting to me because
family is the most important thing in the world to
me. And one must be prepared to pay any price ...
to protect it. Wouldn't you agree?
ERNIE
(weakly)
I completely agree.
HANK
We'll talk some more, Ernie. I always enjoyed our
talks out in the yard - Man to man, prisoner to
prisoner.
Norma and Vivian return, Ernie rises abruptly. Hank more leisurely.
NORMA
We're back.
HANK
(raises his glass)
I'd like to propose a toast ... to the newlyweds and
their happiness.
VIVIAN
(less than sincere)
Thank you, Henry. What a nice gesture.
HANK
To Ernie and Vivian ... may the future bring them
much success.
(he looks at Ernie)
... in all their future dealings.
They all drink, Hank gulps his. We move in on Norma watching Hank and Ernie's reaction.
She senses something's up.

 INT. HALLWAY GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT
POV: Moving slowly down the hallway toward a door, we stop, room 3
CUT TO:
 INT. COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT
We pull back from the curtains, blowing in the wind, pass over an untouched piece of pie,
stop on a shirtless Cooper, changing the dressing on his wound, still wearing his shoulder
holster. He picks up his mini recorder.
COOPER
Diane, 11:05, pm. Great Northern Hotel. Not a
star in the sky tonight. Ben Horne's in custody. If
the Great Northern grieves it bears its sadness in
silence ... the trail narrows, Diane. I'm close, but the
last few steps are always the darkest and most
difficult ...
A gust of wind wildly blows the curtains. Cooper, turns looks at it, there's a knock on the
door. He turns off the recorder, picks up his gun from the table. Cautiously walks to the
door. Opens it. AUDREY stands looking at a shirtless Cooper, holding a gun.
COOPER
Audrey.
They look at each other for a moment.
AUDREY
Can I come in? Talk?
COOPER
Of course.
She enters. Cooper reholsters his gun, Audrey looks at his wound.
AUDREY
Is that where you got shot?
COOPER
Yes.
She wants to reach out and touch it, but doesn't. Then embarrassed, turns around and looks
out the window.
AUDREY
You arrested him?
COOPER
Yes.
AUDREY
Did he do it?

 
COOPER
That's for the court to decide.
AUDREY
What do you think?
COOPER
What I think ... doesn't matter right now.
AUDREY
Did you arrest him because of... what I said?
COOPER
(trying to be kind)
Only in part.
AUDREY
But I helped.
COOPER
(pause, can't be)
Yes.
AUDREY
(pause)
All I ever really wanted was for him to love me.
COOPER
I'm sure he does.
AUDREY
(emotionally)
He's ashamed of me ...
COOPER
No.
AUDREY
(needs forgiveness from somewhere)
Agent Cooper, when I was at One Eyed Jacks, I
never ... I never let anyone ...
COOPER
You don't have to say anything.
AUDREY
Just so you know 


COOPER
(strong)
I know.
She looks at him longingly. Starts to reach out to touch him. The phone rings. Pause.
COOPER
I have to get that.
AUDREY
(almost speechless)
OK.
Cooper answers the phone.
COOPER
Hello.
(immediate concern)
Where? How long ago? I'm on my way.
He hangs up, reaches for his shirt. Audrey senses the seriousness of the call.
AUDREY
What's wrong?
(galvanized, hiding levels of concern)
Audrey, want you to go to your room and lock the
door. Stay there.
AUDREY
Why?
COOPER
No questions. Do this for me.
She looks into his eyes.
AUDREY
All right.
CUT TO:
 EXT. WATERFALL NIGHT
Water rushing, misting. A pool near the bottom of the falls. Flashlights. Hawk, Cooper,
Truman. Ambulance attendants. A body, alive or dead we're not sure, being pulled from the
water and laid on a stretcher.




 
TRUMAN
Coop ... it's Maddy Ferguson.
They watch the stretcher being carried away.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
SHERIFF TRUMAN angry and frustrated, walks with AGENT COOPER, HAWK, and
ALBERT ROSENFIELD through the hospital/morgue parking lot. It's early. A thick fog,
hangs in the air.
ALBERT
The short answer is it's the work of the same ghoul who
killed Laura.
(drops a cellophane container in Cooper's hands)
More fan mail. An "O" under Maddy's ring fingernail ...
(he gives another cellophane container to Cooper)
She had strands of fur clutched in her right hand.
COOPER
What kind of fur?
ALBERT
White fox. The strands are laced with formaldehyde.
A dead animal. Stuffed.
Truman's not listening. He's got the killer in custody, or so he thinks. Investigative details are
no longer his concern.
TRUMAN
I should make the calls. Leland will know how to get a
hold of Maddy's family COOPER
Don't. Don't call anybody. I need twenty-four hours.
For what?

TRUMAN

COOPER
(quiet, internal)
To finish this.
TRUMAN
(his frustration begins to show)
It is finished.
Stalemate. Albert intervenes, takes Cooper aside.

ALBERT
Cooper ... an observation?
Yes, Albert.

COOPER

ALBERT
I don't where this is headed, but the only one of us with
the coordinates for this destination in their hardware is
you. Lock in. Go on whatever Vision Quest you require,
stand on the rim of the volcano. Stand alone and do
your dance. Just find this beast before he takes another
bite.
(turns to Truman)
And perhaps you could follow behind him with a
buglight attached to a pith helmet.
Albert offers a snide farewell wave to Truman, peels off to his automobile. Cooper steps back
to Truman and Hawk.
COOPER
(to self, almost tenderly)
God help me, I don't know where to start.
Hawk puts a hand on his shoulder.
HAWK
You're on the path. You don't need to know where it
leads. Just follow.
Cooper looks at him. Then to Truman.
TRUMAN
(despite what he believes)
Good luck.



INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY

CUT TO:

DONNA HAYWARD sits in a booth in the morning sun, sipping coffee and working on her
homework. A smiling JAMES HURLEY enters passing by ERNIE NILES who sits at the
counter reading the sports page. Donna beams at James.
DONNA
I thought you'd never get here.

James smiles and gives Donna a morning-after kiss. He slides in across from Donna. Takes a
sip of her coffee.
JAMES
I went out for a ride this morning. Buried the needle.
The engine sounded like music, like hundreds of people
singing some huge song.
DONNA
(with affection)
What were they singing about?
JAMES
(in kind)
What do you think?
DONNA
(loving memory, not coy)
Last night. I could sing about last night.
James digs in his pocket and takes out a small gift-wrapped package.
JAMES
This is for you.
(hands it to Donna)
Open it.
Donna opens the box. Takes out a beautiful, but simple ring with the smallest of diamonds.
Oh, James.

DONNA

JAMES
I wasn't sure what size to get. The girl at the jewelry
store has these big hands so I had to guess ...
(taking her hand)
But I bet ...
He slides the ring on her finger, where one would wear a wedding band.
(it fits)
Perfect.
James ... ?

JAMES
(after a beat)
I think we should always be together.
DONNA
(giddy)
Really?
JAMES
(wry)
Yeah. That okay with you?
DONNA
(re the ring, their lives, everything)
It's perfect.
James leans across the table, means to kiss her, the table and coffee between them. Donna
laughs, James grins. Then gathers her into his arms the best he can, offers a lasting kiss.



CUT TO:

HANK JENNINGS
He slides up next to ERNIE who smiles watching Donna and James.
HANK
You ever in love in the joint, Ern?

Disgusted, Ernie goes back to his paper - the sports pages - trying to avoid Hank
HANK 
Remember that fourth floor game room? Where the
boys did business? You played along or they tossed you
over the rail. Four floors down to the cement. Guy
landed it sounded like a cannon.
ERNIE
I'm not interested in whatever you're selling, Hank.
HANK
No, you got it backwards. You are interested, Ernie. I
got a piece of something North of the Border, little
gambling, some female company. Full service kind of
place. See, Ernie, the way I figure it, your speciality
being arithmatic ERNIE
I have an MBA from Wharton's -


HANK
Excuse me. Here's the deal. I want this operation to
grow. You're a guy who knows how to grease it. I'll need
your help. And a good-sized chunk of Vivian's do-reme. Kind of an "Inlaw Thing."
ERNIE
You're confusing "In-law with Inmate."
HANK
Either way we're talking about prison, aren't we?
ERNIE
Our commonality of wrongdoing has nothing to do with
true bonding.
HANK
No, you see it's just like being back in the joint. 'Cause
we got a fourth floor on the outside, too.

Ernie tries to rise, Hank holds him firmly, moves closer, smiles.
HANK 
Don't make me give you the rail, Ern.
Ernie is chilled by Hank's threat.


NORMA AND VIVIAN SMYTHE

CUT TO:

Norma watches Ernie move away. Vivian sits in front of an omelette.
NORMA
They are up to something.
VIVIAN
Norma, Norma, Norma ... darling, let the scales fall
from your eyes.
(Norma looks at her)
The men you and I fall for are boys. My legacy to you,
I'm afraid, dear; strutting, adorable juveniles. We wipe
their noses, wash their underwear, tie their shoes NORMA
Hank was doing hard time, not juvenile detention.
VIVIAN
That may be. But wherever they find themselves the men
we love spend their life in the dark. And in Ernie's case,









VIVIAN 
he's very good in the dark.
(sexy laugh, then serious)
Our job is to keep them there.
She takes bite of the omelette. Points to it.
VIVIAN
Oh dear. Whatever fowl did you take these eggs from?
NORMA
Are we saying we don't like it?
VIVIAN
I'm afraid I'm going to hit a thumbtack.
NORMA
(frustration, near exploding)
Can't you say anything nice? Mother, I've tried so hard,
I try so hard and, and nothing's good enough for you; no,
let me correct that, nothing I do, I ever do is good
enough VIVIAN
(trying to be light)
The menu's are very presentable (sees the hurt)
I'm joking. Honestly, may I suggest something? If you
want to serve a truly memorable omelette, try some
white veal sausage with some morel mushrooms NORMA
(taking Vivian's plate and moving off)
Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.

4A. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN

CUT TO:

Andy sits at the counter, feeling blue, ignoring the pie before him. He mutters a phrase to
himself, as if to test the words, perhaps commit them to memory.
ANDY
(terrible French)
J'ai une...J'ai une ame solitaire...
Big sigh. Somehow it makes Andy feel better. As Donna and James step toward the register,
he repeats, a little more confidentally:






4A. 

ANDY
J'ai une ame solitaire.
Donna reacts to the familiar phrase with a start.
DONNA
(to Andy)
What did you say?
ANDY
(morose)
Nothing. Hello, Donna and James.
DONNA
(intense)
Tell me what you said.
It's French.

ANDY

DONNA
I know what it is. Tell me.
JAMES
Hey, it's no big deal.
ANDY
(as if to confess)
J'ai une ame solitaire.
DONNA
(sitting at the stool beside him)
How do you know Mrs. Tremond?
ANDY
(now confused)
Mrs. Who?
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond. Her grandson does magic tricks. He
said this to me.
ANDY
But it was Mr. Smith.
DONNA
(now it's her turn to be confused)
Harold ... ?




4A. (2)
Andy nods, leans closer to impart a confidence.
ANDY
He left a suicide note. J'ai une, you know. It means I am
a lonely soul.
DONNA
(rising)
I have to find Agent Cooper.
JAMES
Donna, what the hell is going on?
Donna turns for the door. James calls after, frustrated:
Donna!


JAMES

OMITTED

CUT TO:

5A. EXT. MRS. TREMOND'S HOUSE - DAY
Donna leads Cooper and Andy up the path to Mrs. Tremond's house, directly across from
Harold Smith's. In mid-speech:
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond is the woman who told me about Harold
Smith. She has a grandson. And he said it to me. The
same words that were in Harold Smith's suicide note ...
COOPER
(ignoring Albert, suggesting a possibility)
Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold.
DONNA
Harold's world was in words. The suicide note was a
message, it has to be. And it leads back here ...
Donna knocks on Mrs. Tremond's door. A long beat.
DONNA
(as if explain the delay)
She's pretty old. If her grandson isn't here to open it ...
ANDY
(peering toward window)
There's someone inside.



5A. 
Just then: the door opens, revealing a WOMAN. Middle-aged. Pleasant in appearance. And
most decidedly not Mrs. Tremond.
WOMAN
(seeing Truman's badge)
May I help you ... ?
DONNA
(confused)
Is Mrs. Tremond here?
WOMAN
I'm Mrs. Tremond.
DONNA
Maybe it was your mother I spoke to.
TREMOND
(friendly)
My mother passed away three years ago. I live alone.
DONNA
No. I was here. I talked to her. And her grandson, he
was here too.
TREMOND
(confused, quietly apologetic)
But I have no children.
DONNA
But he was here. They were both here...
COOPER
(puts a comforting hand on her shoulder)
Donna, maybe we should go.
TREMOND
(recognizing the name)
Donna? Donna Hayward?

Yes.

DONNA
(to Tremond)

TREMOND
Just a moment ...
Mrs. Tremond goes back inside.





5A. (2)

DONNA
I've never seen her before in my life.
COOPER
But you said you delivered meals here DONNA
I only went inside once. The first time. When the old
woman told me about Harold. I'm supposed to leave
them on the steps ...

Mrs. Tremond returns holding an envelope.
TREMOND
The morning after poor Harold died, I found this with
my mail. I meant to turn it in ...
(holding it up for them to see)
It's for you.
Mrs. Tremond holds the envelope toward Donna. Her name is written there.
DONNA
It's Harold's handwriting.
Open it.

COOPER

She does. Reveals a single page inside.
DONNA
(stunned, fearful)
It's Laura's diary; A page from her diary.
COOPER
(quietly intense)
Read it, Donna.
A long beat. Donna peering at the familiar handwriting. Finally, in a whisper.
DONNA
(reading with sadness, disbelief)
February 21st. Last night I had the strangest dream. I
was in a red room with a small man dressed in red and
an old man, sitting in a chair.
Cooper reacts. He had the same dream. Laura, the midget, forgotten secrets whispered in his
ear.
INTERCUT DREAM








5A. (3)
DONNA 
I tried to talk to him. I wanted to tell him who Bob is
because I thought he could help me. But my words came
out slow and odd. It was so frustrating trying to talk. I
got up and walked over to the old man. Like I was
going to kiss him. Then I leaned over and whispered the
secret in his ear. I told him everything.
(beat)
Somebody has to stop Bob. Bob's only afraid of one
man. He told me once. A man named Mike. I wonder
if this was Mike in my dream. Even if it was only a
dream, I hope he heard me. No one in the real world
would believe me.
Donna completes the page, now turns to the other side. She reads:
DONNA
February 22nd. Tonight is the night that I die.
(quiet gasp, a look at Cooper)
I know I have to because it is the only way to keep Bob
away from me. The only way to tear him out from
inside. I know he wants me. I can feel his fire. But if I
die he can't hurt me anymore.
(Donna begins to weep)
I'm not afraid. I'll miss Donna and James. I'll miss my
home. But I'm tired and Bob won't let me rest. Death
will be like sleeping. I'm almost happy. And best of
all ... I'm free.
Donna looks up at Cooper, tears on her face. Andy's crying too. He puts his arm around her,
comforts her.
COOPER
Laura and I had the same dream. But in her dream I was
Mike.
ANDY
That's ... that's impossible.
COOPER
Yes, it is. Andy, take Donna home. I've got to find
Gerard.
Cooper moves off.
FADE TO BLACK
END ACT ONE


ACT TWO



FADE IN:
5C. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Cooper enters cautiously. PHILLIP GERARD, wheezing and barely conscious, lies without
bedclothes on a stripped mattress. DOC HAYWARD lays wet compresses on Gerard's
forehead. Cooper moves to Hayward.
DOC
He's completely dehydrated. Breathing getting more
difficult. He needs the drug.
Cooper moves to kneel beside Gerard.
COOPER
"Mike?" Mike, I need to speak to you.
DOC
Any longer could kill him.
A terrifying groan from Gerard.
"Mike?"

COOPER

Gerard opens his eyes, takes Cooper's hand, nods, weakly.
COOPER
There isn't much time. Bob has killed again.
Gerard winces, pained, looks away. Cooper brings him back.
COOPER 
I'm close to knowing. But the last distance to close is
the most difficult. I need to know something. I need
you to help me.
Gerard nods, grasps his hand, eager to help.
COOPER 
Bob was in my dream. So was Laura Palmer. So were
you. And Laura dreamt about me the night before she
died. The same dream. I need to go back there and
unlock my dream. The answer is inside.
He leans over him to hear. Gerard struggles with every word. Fighting to stay Mike.
GERARD
Bob is a fire spirit. So are we both, both creatures of





5C. 

GERARD 
fire. Bob and I ... when we were killing together ... there
was a perfect relationship; appetite and satisfaction. A
golden circle.
COOPER
(trying to decipher)
A golden circle ...

Gerard gives him the "OK" sign. Which triggers another thought for Cooper.
COOPER 
A ring. My ring. I gave my ring to someone. The
Giant.
GERARD
He is known to us here.
COOPER
The Giant. Is he real?
GERARD
As real as I am. He can lead you to Bob.
How?

COOPER

GERARD
You have to ask him first.
COOPER
I'm sorry, I don't understand GERARD
You have all the clues you need. The answer's not here,
my friend.
(he gently touches Cooper's head)
The answer is here.
He touches Cooper's chest.
COOPER
I don't understand, please GERARD
So much responsibility.
Gerard goes slack in his arms. "Mike" is gone. Cooper holds Gerard's limp body. He looks
at Doc.
CUT TO:







5D. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALLWAY - DAY
Cooper exits Gerard's room. He stops to think. Behind him, around the corner comes the
world's oldest ROOM SERVICE WAITER. He's carrying a tray with a glass of milk. He
stops to look at Cooper. Cooper realizes he's being watch and turns.
WAITER
I know about you.
The Waiter winks at him. Cooper looks at him puzzled.
WAITER 
That milk'll cool down on you, but it's getting warmer now.
The Waiter gives him a thumbs up and moves slowly along.
COOPER
(to himself)
... getting warmer now.
The Waiter turns once, gives him another thumbs up and disappears around the corner.


INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

Sound of DISTANT THUNDER outside. A storm is approaching. Truman and a team of
deputies are methodically searching the room. Truman going through records at the desk.
TRUMAN
(to a deputy)
Box and tag everything in these drawers.
Cooper appears, pauses on the steps by the door.
TRUMAN 
Coop. We found Horne's phone records.
(Truman moves to him)
Here it is. The night Laura died. The phone call Leland
told us about. Ben called her number from this office.
Cooper spots the STUFFED FOX in the office, walks to it, as if he was the only person in
the room. Examines the fur.
White fox.

COOPER

TRUMAN
White, dead and stuffed.


.5d





TRUMAN
Maddy was here. There was a struggle; she grabbed this
thing. Ben killed her in this office, then took her to the
waterfall. He killed Laura and he killed Maddy, too.
Albert stands in the doorway from the inner office. He steps through the deputies to Cooper.
ALBERT
(handing Cooper an envelope)
Madelaine Ferguson died night before last between ten
p.m. and midnight.
TRUMAN
Ben Horne was in custody by midnight.
ALBERT
That's as close as I can cut it.
(hands him an envelope, quietly)
Ben Horne's blood test.
Cooper glances at the information inside, hands paper to Albert. Albert peers at the results.
Then, gradually, hands them to Truman. HOLD ON Truman for a beat. His ambiguous
expression.
ALBERT 
(Cooper isn't listening)
Cooper?
Cooper turns to Albert and Truman.
COOPER
I'll need you both to do exactly as I say. I have a plan.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
The now-familiar plumber, ZIPPER, stands on a ladder at reception, working on a sprinklersystem nozzle in the ceiling. Lucy sits below the ladder at her desk
ZIPPER
... 'nother couple minutes, I'll have this baby right up to
code. Tweaking the sensors mostly. Don't want your
sprinklers to be overly jumpy, you gotta set it just so ...








ANDY BRENNAN suddenly appears on the other side of the ladder.
ANDY
I want to talk about my child.
(impassioned whisper)
Our baby, Lucy.
LUCY
(troubled)
Maybe.
ANDY
Maybe what?
LUCY
Maybe it is our baby. Maybe it isn't.
ANDY
(stunned)
Dick? Oh my Lord. Is he the father?
LUCY
At first I thought you were the father. But then you said
you didn't have any sperms. Then I thought it was Dick.
But now you tell me your sperms are better so as far as I
can tell it's a fifty-fifty proposition.
Andy grabs the phone, begins to dial with grim determination.
LUCY
Andy? What are you doing? Who are you calling?
ANDY
I want to speak with Richard Tremayne, please. Men's
Fashions. Yes, I'll hold.
LUCY
(almost hoping)
You won't hurt him, will you?
Andy flashes a look at Lucy worthy of John Wayne. I'll do what I have to do. Lucy melts just a
little. Andy takes a deep breath.
ANDY
Tremayne? Brennan. Andy Brennan. We need to talk.
(losing his resolve)
That is, if you're not too busy.
CUT TO:




INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Ben Horne aimlessly pitches pennies against his cell wall. A DEPUTY opens the door.
Tojomura steps into view, pauses. Ben smiles as if they were meeting at a Men's Club.
BEN
Tojomura-san. How nice of you to come calling.
TOJOMURA
(to the point)
You are in prison.
BEN
A momentary inconvenience, I assure you.
For whom?

TOJOMURA

Tojomura's sarcasm, however muted, takes Ben by surprise.
BEN
(cautious)
Only myself. Can I help you in any way?
TOJOMURA
(extracts a sheaf of papers from his jacket)
We have papers to sign.
BEN
(getting that sinking feeling)
The Ghostwood contracts. Tojomura-san, I'm afraid
there's been a snag.
Snag?

TOJOMURA

BEN
(squirming)
The usual business disputes, delays. Unforeseen
difficulties, some legal in nature, others ... I'm not able
to sign the Ghostwood agreement at this time.
TOJOMURA
I gave you five million dollars.
BEN
(remembering, sinking deeper)
Your check.
Yes. Pen?

TOJOMURA








BEN
But I cannot sign.
TOJOMURA
Then you will return my money?
BEN
Well, I want to return your money, I want to sign the
contracts for Chrissakes ...
(voice set to quiver with counterfeit emotion)
Tojomura-san, as you can see, I am incarcerated.
Falsely accused. My brother the boy-genius is out
looking for a better lawyer. And until justice is done,
until I am able to breathe the air that free men breathe ...
(he pauses for dramatic effect)
I plead with you for understanding. This is the long
dark night of my soul. A time to seek that tiny
flickering flame within. Business my God, I can hardly
consider it, let alone competently proceed with our
negotiations
(hangs his head, whispers)
Forgive me I've been rather emotional lately ...
Ben pauses. He'd cry if he could force a few measly tears from his ducts. A beat. Faint noise
from outside the cell. And last is a naked foot comes INTO VIEW, placed gently between
the bars, toenails painted a bright cherry red. Ben, head hanging, stares down at them. His
brain reels. He'd know those toes anywhere.
BEN
Ca ... Ca ... Catherine?
Ben looks up, amazed. Tojomura speaks in the VOICE of CATHERINE MARTELL.
CATHERINE/TOJOMURA
(with affection)
Benjamin Home, you're a slimey rat bastard. And I
intend to make whatever remains of your pathetic
existance a living hell. Despite which, I can't help
admiring your style just the tiniest bit ...
(quoting with relish)
"...that tiny flickering flame within."
Overcome, Ben takes Catherine's foot into his hands. As if to caress and kiss it.
BEN
Oh, Catherine. Oh thank God you've come. You're my
only chance. My salvation.







(2)
CATHERINE
Why, Ben. You're groveling.
BEN
Yes I'm groveling. Dammit, I'm groveling for my life.
Tell Sheriff Truman about the night we spent together.
The night Laura was killed. Do you want me to beg?
Because I will.
CATHERINE
Will you sign over Ghostwood and the mill to me?
BEN
In a heartbeat.
Catherine thrusts the contracts through the bars and smiles. Ben scribbles his signature upon
the contracts. Catherine slips her naked foot back into its shoe.
BEN
Clever disguise, Catherine. Brilliant really. Had me
completely snowed. I have to hand it to you. Signed,
sealed, delivered ...
(hands the contracts back with an unotious smile)
And so you'Il tell the Sheriff ...?
CATHERINE
I'll ... consider it.
Catherine slips the contract into her jacket pocket, steps away. Ben hisses after.
BEN
Catherine! Wait a minute! Catherine!! Wait!
(exasperated)
My God, it's the truth after all!
Catherine pauses at the door, regards him with a wicked smile.
CATHERINE
Why, Ben. We've been lying to each other all our adult
lives. Why let the truth spoil it now?
And with that, Catherine walks away.
BEN
Catherine?! Catherine!!

CUT TO:
 INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
Donna stands in the living room, wearing Laura's dark glasses. Leland beams.
LELAND
Donna, I'm so happy you stopped by. We haven't really
had time to sit down and talk in so long, Can I offer
you a glass of lemonade?
DONNA
No, thank you, Mr. Palmer. I only have a minute...
(takes a cassette tape from her pocket)
This is for Maddy. It's a tape of a song we did with
James. I wanted her to have a copy.
LELAND
(taking tape, pages through)
Of course. How sweet of you. Maddy told me all
about that. She said she really enjoyed the experience.
DONNA
Well anyway. If you could mail it to her I'd really
appreciate it.
LELAND
That won't be any trouble at all.
Donna notices Leland staring at her glasses.
DONNA
Is something wrong?
LELAND
No ... those glasses ...
DONNA
They were Laura's. Maddy gave them to me.
LELAND
I thought they looked familiar.
Donna takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
DONNA
Mr. Palmer, did you know they found Laura's secret










 
diary?

DONNA 

LELAND
(hiding his agitation)
Diary? Yes, they took it from her room.
DONNA
Not the one the police took. She kept another diary.
She never even told me about it, did you know?
No.

LELAND

DONNA
She gave it to a man named Harold Smith. He killed
himself three days ago. The police found it in his
apartment.
LELAND
My God. I had no idea.
DONNA
I wish I knew, what was in it, don't you? I think about
her all the time. I must dream about Laura every night.
Just then: the phone RINGS.
Excuse me...

LELAND

Leland moves into the alcove to answer the phone.
LELAND
Hello ... Beth, how are you? ... No, not since yesterday ...
Of course, I put Maddy on the bus myself ... I'm sure
there's a perfectly reasonable explanation ... yes, I'll call
you immediately, within the hour. 'Bye.
Donna has taken tentative steps toward him during the latter. He hangs up and turns to her.
Maddy?

DONNA

LELAND
It's the strangest thing. She never made it home.

ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY
DONNA
I knew Maddy was expecting us the other night. But I
was selfish. I figured I could see her any time. I mean
Missoula's not that far away ...
LELAND
Donna, you musn't take this to heart. I'm sure she's fine.
(a comforting hand upon her shoulder)
I've got the cure for what ails you. It's simple, really.
But it always improves my mood.
Leland scurries over to the stereo, sets needle to vinyl. An old thirties dance tune is HEARD.
He does a couple of soft shoe steps in Donna's direction. Then ... a KNOCK at the door.
LELAND
Wait right here.
Leland steps off to answer. He opens the door, Sheriff Truman man enters, brushes rain from
his coat. They converse quietly in the alcove. Donna remains out of sight.
Harry.

LELAND

TRUMAN
Leland, we need your help.
What is it?

LELAND

TRUMAN
I'm afraid there's been another murder.
LELAND
Oh my God. Oh my God, that's dreadful.
TRUMAN
Leland, we're closing in on Laura's killer. I can't tell
you why or how but we need your help and we need it
now.
LELAND
Of course. Certainly. Anything. Let me get my coat.



 
Leland grabs a jacket from a hanger nearby. He steps with Truman toward the door,
glancing briefly toward the living room, Donna left behind him.
Donna listens to the door slam. Her eyes bright with tears. There has been another murder.
 EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
Doc Hayward works in his yard. He sighs, full of sadness.

DISSOLVE TO:

DONNA

Dad?
Hayward looks up, sees Donna standing before him. Full of sorrow. And rage. Hayward gets
to his feet. A beat, then:
DONNA
It's Maddy, isn't it? She's dead.
HAYWARD
Let's not talk about it now.
DONNA
(she will not be comforted)
Tell me the truth.
HAYWARD
(pause)
I'm so sorry. Yes, she's...
How?

DONNA

HAYWARD
(as delicately as he can put)
Like Laura.
No ... no ...

DONNA
HAYWARD

Baby ...
Donna shudders with anger, overcome. Her father steps to her, tries to take Donna into his
arms. But Donna rips free from his grasp. She will not be comforted.
DONNA
NO! I am sick and tired of all this pain. Sick in my
heart. Everything good turns to bad. No matter what






.5c
 


DONNA 
we say or do. No matter how hard we try. Someone has
to stop it. Someone has to ...
HAYWARD

I love you, Donna.
DONNA

I don't want to talk about love. I...

Donna can't stand it. She turns and runs.
DISSOLVE TO:

 EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - DAY

Establish. The storm now grips the region. Thunder and lightning in the dark sky.
CUT TO:

 INT. THE ROADHOUSE -DAY

Truman and Leland walk through the Roadhouse interior. Cooper and Albert are sitting at
the bar. The mood is dreamlike, eerie. And will remain so throughout the following,
punctuated by the sound of the storm outside.
LELAND
Why are we here? Agent Cooper? Is someone meeting
us?
Yes.
The killer?

COOPER
LELAND

COOPER
I don't know. Perhaps.
The main door opens. Big Ed Hurley enters; Ed looks about, a little confused.
ED
What's going on here?
COOPER
I want everyone to help me clear the floor. We're going




COOPER 
to need a large clear space in the center.
Of course.

LELAND

ALBERT
(aggresively cheerful)
Only too happy to help.
Cooper hefts a chair, moves it from the center of the room. Ed, Hawk, Albert and Leland
grab chairs, slide them toward the walls. Cooper returns to push at a table.
ED
(aside to Cooper, his real reason for being here)
You need me, just give the word.
Ed gives the Bookhouse Boys sign.
SHELLY JOHNSON wheels LEO JOHNSON into the room. Muttering, Bobby Briggs is
led in by Hawk.
BOBBY
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.
COOPER
Bobby, wheel Leo to the bar and be very, very quiet. Do
you read me?
Bobby sighs, wheels Leo as directed.
Cooper clears the last table to the side. There is now a large open space at the center of the
room. Cooper turns to regard it, checks his watch as if expecting someone else. All eyes are
upon him. Ed and the others watch Cooper with varying degrees of confusion.
The main door OPENS, Truman escorts Ben Horne inside. All turn to view him.
BEN
(a pause, cold)
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.
Truman leads Ben to the others. Cooper turns to address the group.



COOPER
(finishes, turns to the group)
Two days ago, another young woman was murdered by
the indivudual responsible for the death of Laura Palmer.
I have reason to believe the killer is inside this room.

Some react with looks of disbelief - followed by glances at the men next to them. BEN
keeps a cold eye on Cooper.
COOPER 
As a Federal Agent I spend most of my time seeking
simple answers to difficult questions. In pursuit of
Laura's killer, I have used Bureau guidelines, deductive
technique, Tibetan method, instinct and luck. But now I
find myself in need of something new. Which, for lack
of a better word, we will call magic.
Pause. Cooper looks at the door, at his watch. The suspects stand together, nervous,
uncertain.
BEN
Would you like us to hum? Perhaps some pagan chant ...
Truman and Albert move to Cooper.
ALBERT
(quiet, cheerful)
I think it's going terrifically well, don't you?
Now what?

TRUMAN

COOPER
I'm not completely sure. Someone's missing.
Who?

TRUMAN

ALBERT
Brian, the leprechaun king?
LIGHTNING AND THUNDER. Cooper looks at the suspects. He looks at his watch. He
peers at the large clock above the bar; it strikes three o'clock. Three soft resonant bongs.
A noise from the Roadhouse entrance, the door opens, light pours into the room. Cooper
pivots to see the familiar silhouette of MAJOR BRIGGS. Accompanied by the Room
Service Waiter.
BRIGGS
Excuse us ...


COOPER
(with a small smile of relief)
Major, you're right on time.
BRIGGS
I was on my way home. This kind gentleman flagged
me down, asked if I could drive him here.

Cooper and the Waiter look at each other. The Waiter winks at him. Gives him a thumbs up.
Takes out a pack of gum and extends the pack. Cooper takes out a stick. There's a lightning
bolt on the wrapper. Cooper puts the stick in his mouth. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
BEN
(sees the pack)

INTERCUT:
 COOPER'S DREAM
Cooper is back in a dream. He looks down. On the roadhouse floor, a familiar mound of
dirt appears at his feet. Something gold gleams inside it: Laura's heart necklace. But the
heart is no longer halved, both pieces are joined. The heart shimmers, disappears:
Out of it the fabric of his vision tears, shifts. And Cooper finds himself back in a familiar red
room. The dream first seen in episode #0 Cooper sits in the armchair, mute. Laura leans
close to him, smiling. She whispers. But this time Cooper hears and comprehends ...
LAURA
Ben Horne killed me.
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.

CUT TO:
We're back in the roadhouse. The GIANT appears holding Cooper's ring in the palm of his
hand. In the same brilliant flash of light, the Giant disappears and Cooper's ring falls out of
the air, bounces and rolls to a stop at Cooper's feet. He bends to pick it up. Slips it on his
finger. We MOVE in on him. A long beat. Then, quiet, stern, Cooper turns toward Ben
Horne.
COOPER
Ben, I would like you to accompany me to the Sheriff's
station. You might want to bring Leland with you. As
your attorney.
Cooper nods to Truman. The Sheriff cuffs a stunned Ben Horne and leads him away. Deputy
Hawk steps to Cooper.

HAWK
The quest is over?
COOPER
(motioning him closer)
One thing more.

Hawk leans to receive his whisper. Hawk walks to the door. Cooper follows at first and then
stops. He looks back towards the stage. He sees the Room Service Waiter wave at him and
smile.

What is it? What's the matter?
Maddy ...

DONNA

JAMES
What about her?
DONNA
She's dead. It was the killer. The one who killed
Laura. She's dead.
Stunned, he moves away. His legs give way near the shore. Donna watches him helplessly.
No ... no ...

JAMES

DONNA
(unfocused rambling)
I heard Mr. Palmer get a call from her, from her
mother, she said she hadn't gotten home, they came to
talk to him, Sheriff Truman and so I went home, my
father he was so upset he couldn't keep it from me ...
She starts to cry. They can't comfort each other.
JAMES
We could've helped her.
How?

DONNA






 
JAMES
I don't know
(his anger startles them both; he suddenly sees a
gulf between them)
It's no good.
DONNA

You mean us?
JAMES
We can't do this. It's no good.
DONNA
What did we do? What did we do?
Pause.
JAMES
I've got to go. I've got to go.
He starts for his bike.
DONNA
James, don't leave ... it's not our fault!
JAMES
It doesn't matter. Don't you see? Nothing we do
matters. Nothing's ever going to change. It doesn't
matter if we're happy when the rest of the world goes to
hell DONNA
Don't leave - James - don't leave me alone!
He gets on his bike and rides. Anguished, Donna turns toward the lake, weeping, stepping

In the basement, around the corner from interrogation. Hawk leads Ben towards the door, as
Truman moves ahead to unlock it. Cooper and Leland follow them around the corner.
Truman unlocks the door, swings it open. Hawk grabs Ben from behind, moves him
forcefully into interrogation.
The moment Ben realizes he is locked in, he begins to howl like a caged wolf. Truman slams
the door shut, Hawk locks it.
The howling continues, a rabid sound; Ben, or rather "Bob", careens around the room,
pounding on the walls, searching for an escape that doesn't exist, his incoherent cries echoing
like the tortures of the damned.
Leland stands by, stunned, speechless.
LELAND

HAWK

That's not Ben.
A gesture from Cooper and Hawk leads Leland back around the corner.

Truman, Hawk, Albert and Cooper face Ben, sitting in a chair, handcuffs in front of him..
TRUMAN
(shaken)
- you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford
an attorney one will be appointed for you ...
Ben begins to laugh, a low, feral sound, snarling and contemptuous.
TRUMAN 
Do you understand your rights as we've explained them
to you?
BEN
Of course he does.

I suppose you want to ask him some questions.
COOPER
Did you kill Laura Palmer?
Ben hoots and howls. Then ...
That's a yes.

BEN

COOPER
Did you kill Madeleine Ferguson?
BEN
What do you think?
COOPER
I'm asking you.
BEN
(like a shy kid)
Yeah, well, I guess I sort'a did, kind'a. I have a thing
for knives ...
(cold and hard)
... kind of like that time in Pittsburgh, huh Cooper?

22A. 
Cooper pales.
BEN 
Ben's been a good vehicle. I've enjoyed the ride. But
he's weak now and riddled with holes. It's nearly time
to shuffle off to Buffalo.
TRUMAN
Does Ben know what you've done?

BEN
Ben's a babe in the woods. With a large hole where his
conscience used to be. And when I go, children, I'll pull
the ripcord and you watch Ben remember. But not for
long ...
He laughs again wildly then stops with a jerk. His eyes close. "Bob" seems to be resting or
waiting. Truman and Cooper look at each other.
TRUMAN
That's good enough for me.
The group exits the room quietly.

Lucy faces both Tremayne and Andy. Tremayne reaches nervously for a cigarette.

Tremayne lights his cigarette with a lighter, speaks to Lucy.
TREMAYNE
You were saying ...
LUCY
There's only one way to handle this. They have a test to
determine the blood type of the father. It could be you
or it could be you.
Tremayne looks Andy up and down.
LUCY 
They won't be doing that test until the baby is born.
During which time I expect complete cooperation from
you two "gentlemen."
TREMAYNE
Whatever you say, Lucy. I mean, it's your baby.
LUCY

Thank you.
The smoke from Tremayne's cigarette drifts lazily up to the ceiling. Towards the newly

CUT TO:

Hawk continues to monitor Ben thru the window. Cooper speaks urgently. Takes a piece of
paper from his pocket hands it to Truman.
COOPER
Ben Horne's blood test.
TRUMAN
Why? Why did he kill her?
COOPER
Laura wrote about Bob in her diary; Ben found it, ripped
out the pages and she knew he was onto her. Ben placed
that call to Laura from Ben's office the night she died.
He was the Third man outside Jacques' cabin. He took
both girls to the train car. It was his blood we found,
not Ben Horne's.
TRUMAN
Then why kill Maddy?
COOPER
She reminded him of Laura. Maddy was going home,
maybe he couldn't bear to part with her. He wanted to
relive the experience. Or maybe she realized Bob was
the killer and he found out.
TRUMAN
But there can't really be a "Bob." I mean Ben's just
crazy Isn't he?
Truman, Hawk, Cooper and Albert look at each other. Ben's howls fill the air.
ALBERT

From inside the room they hear Ben's voice.

With a terrifying, howl Ben/Bob bolts up from his seat and howls at the rain. Then he rushes

his head.
The foursome sprint into the room. Cooper rushes to Ben, wet and still on the ground,
water continuing to fall in this room.

Hawk rushes out of the room. Cooper gathers Ben in his arms. Truman, Albert stand by.

Ben's eyes flutter open. It's Ben. Bob is gone. And Ben is dying.

Where ... where am I?
COOPER
You're here. Lie still.
Ben spasms, a seizure gripping him. Albert helps Cooper restrain him, pulling his tongue
from down his throat. It subsides. Ben moans, as his eyes reopen.
BEN
The shadow ... he's gone ... I ... I remember ...
(the images flood back)
Oh, my God ... Laura ...
(he sees it all now, the tortures of the damned)
I killed her ... oh my God, I killed her ... I didn't
know, I didn't know ... Laura, darling, forgive me ...
COOPER
It's all right. It's all right.
BEN
I was just a little boy. I saw him in my dreams. He
said he wanted to play ...
(reliving the terror)
... and he opened me ... and I invited him ... and he came
inside me ...
COOPER.
(gently prompting)
He went inside.
BEN
When he was in me, I didn't know ... when he was gone, I
couldn't remember ... he made me do things ... terrible
things ... he wanted life ... he wanted others, others they
could use, the way they used me ...
Laura?

COOPER

BEN
They wanted Laura ... they wanted her, but she was strong
... she fought them, she wouldn't let them in ... they
made me kill that girl, Theresa, they said if I didn't
give Laura to them they'd make me kill her too ...

Tears are streaming down Truman's face as he listens. Albert is anguished. Cooper
presses on.
COOPER
But she wouldn't give in.
BEN
She said she'd die before she'd let them ... they made
me kill her ... God have mercy on me, what have I done?
What have I done? I love her ... I loved her with all my
heart ...
COOPER
Be quiet now. Lie quiet.
BEN
Laura, forgive me ... ...
Ben is fading. Albert checks him out, looks at Cooper, shakes his head. Cooper turns BEN
gently so that he's lying on his right side, holds him and begins to speak softly in his ear. The
Tibetan Book of the Dead.
COOPER
Ben, the time has come for you to seek the Path. Your
soul has set you face to face before the clear light ... and
now you are about to experience it in its Reality, wherein
all things are like the void and cloudless sky, and the
naked, spotless intellect is like a transparent vaccum,
without circumference or center ...
Ben's face calms. His eyes clear. Albert and Truman watch, electrified.
COOPER 
At this moment, know yourself and abide in that state ...
(gently places two fin gers on his carotid artery)
Look towards the light, Ben, look towards the light.
BEN

I see it ...

Move towards it now ... into the light ... into the light ...

BRIGGS

That question may require a bit more self-examination.
TRUMAN
I've lived in these woods all my life. I've heard some
strange things. Seen some too. But this is way off the
map. I'm having a hard time believing.
COOPER
Is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his
own daughter? Is that any more comforting?

No.

TRUMAN

BRIGGS
An evil that great in this beautiful world. Finally, does
it matter what the cause?
COOPER
Yes. Because it's our job to stop it.
Briggs thinks, agrees, nods.

Maybe that's all "Bob" is. The evil that men do.
Maybe it doesn't matter what we call it.
Pause. No one seems to disagree.

HAYWARD
Sarah I'd like you to take this.
COOPER sits in a chair opposite them.
SARAH
No, Doc, I don't want it. I want to be there. Every
single part of me needs to be there - for both of them.
(looks at Cooper struggling to understand)
Today I bury my husband. Next to my only child. Her
grave is still fresh. There's just a little bit of grass on it.
She stops, numb with grief. Cooper leans in.
COOPER
Mrs. Palmer, there are things dark and heinous in this
world. Things too horrible to tell our children. Your
husband fell victim to one of them. Long ago, when he
was innocent and trusting. Leland didn't commit these
crimes. Not the Leland you knew.
SARAH

The man I saw. That disgusting long hair.
COOPER
He's gone. Forever.
SARAH
So is everything dear to me.
COOPER
Laura and Leland have gone from this life to the next. But
they're with you always. Here ... and here ...

COOPER 
The experience we have of people doesn't leave when they
do. If you close your eyes, you can see Laura blowing out
the candles on her birthday cake, Leland mowing the
yard, shaving at the sink ...

Those moments are yours. Always.

SARAH
Thank you very much.
Hank pauses to receive her gratitude, then looks up, reacts. BIG ED HURLEY and NORMA
JENNINGS stand together across the room. Talking quietly, sharing some confidence.
Hank scowls, watches as Norma steps away. Then returns to the buffet.
AUDREY

Do you invite people to these things or do they just show
up?
EILEEN
At a time like this people just naturally come together.
It is a time of reaching out. I remember when my mother
died there must have been a hundred people.
SARAH
I remember. Donna came to see Laura that night. They
promised they'd be best friends for life. A bond against
dying ...
Eileen reacts - feeling bad for bringing this up.
SARAH 
No, please, I want to remember. Donna spent the night

That's great, honey. Why don't you practice your splits?

He shuts the door, and sits back down. Greege tries to recover ...
GREEGE
She's certainly trying to recapture that old school spirit.
JACOBY
A classic case of clinical regression. Mr. Greege, what's
important here is that Nadine be allowed to maintain her
own reality. Being eighteen is all she can manage. And it
could be a lot worse. Be glad she's not napping in a crib.
Ed shudders. Greege reaches his decision.
GREEGE
We will admit her under one condition: she has to
perform like a regular student. Ed, my advice to you is
can forget hot dinners. Nadine'll be busy doing her
homework like every other senior.
Ed nods. Grimaces. Another body blow.

AUDREY
(being light)
What happened, did they die or something?
COOPER
As a matter of fact she did. Would you like to know how?
(after a beat, she looks away; trying to shock)
She was a material witness to a federal crime. We were
supposed to protect her. Twenty-four hours a day.
Myself and my partner, the man who taught me
everything I know about being a special agent. I fell in
love with her. And when the attempt on her life was
finally made I wasn't ready. Because I loved her. She
died in my arms. I was badly wounded. And my
partner, Windom Earle was his name, lost his mind. Do
you need me to be more specific?
Audrey, chastened and horrified, shakes her head.
COOPER 
I like you, Audrey and I care for you. I'll always
consider you my friend.

AUDREY
(quoting him)
Friendship is the foundation of any lasting relationship.
COOPER
It's nice to be quoted accurately.
AUDREY
Well let me tell you something, Agent Cooper; one of
these days, before you know it, I'll be grown-up and on
my own. And you just better watch out.
COOPER
(likes the idea)
Okay Audrey. It's a deal.

With as much dignity as she can muster, she walks to the door, opens it and turns back to him.
AUDREY
There's only one problem with you. You're perfect.
She slips out, closing the door. Cooper sits down hard on the bed.
COOPER
Sometimes it's a burden.
 INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO:

CLOSE ON BOBBY'S REFLECTION in a MIRROR, trying on a shiny, blue sharkskin suit a little baggy. We PULL BACK to reveal the mirror is propped up in LEO'S LAP. Several
TIES are draped over one of Leo's arms, and a SHIRT hangs from the back of his head.
BOBBY
It's big - but it's bad.
He looks over at Shelly, wearing sweatpants and a man's shirt - tired and depressed.
SHELLY
Leo just got that suit. Fits him a little tighter.
BOBBY
Well it's a shame to let good threads go to waste.
(grabs a BLUE TIE off Leo's arm)
What do ya think- blue or green? I gotta look good. Ben
Horne's a man who notices these things.
SHELLY
You look great. Bobby, take me out tonight. I'll get all





 dressed up -


SHELLY 

BOBBY
What about the Leo?
SHELLY
I'll get a sitter! Bobby, please, I've got to get out of
here. I'm going crazy!
BOBBY
Sweetheart, lover, listen to me. If I land this "job" with
Mr. Horne, we're on easy street. I'll take care of you in
ways you never dreamed of. Hang in there, and let
Bobby do his thing.
(taking her in his arms)
It's for us, baby.
Over her shoulder, Bobby winks at Leo. He then he kisses her - long and deep. Shelly melts.
Okay?

BOBBY

She nods, placated. Bobby breaks away.
BOBBY 
I gotta ramble. So which is it: blue or green?
Leo GURGLES.
BOBBY 
He likes the green. My man Leo.
(grabs the green tie and heads for the door)
Doll face, cross your fingers, cross your toes. This is the
big time.
The door slams. We HOLD ON Shelly's face, abandoned. She looks over at Leo, holding
the mirror, a human valet - and starts to cry.
 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

CATHERINE MARTELL stands, looking out a window. Truman walks in carrying a cup of
coffee and a small PAPER SACK. Truman sees her, stops short. Nearly drops his coffee.
CATHERINE
Hello, Harry.
TRUMAN
Forgive my saying so, Catherine. But you're dead.




 
Catherine shrugs, enjoying his consternation.


TRUMAN
Does Pete know?
CATHERINE
My husband and I have been duly reunited.
TRUMAN
(figuring)
Well, all things considered... Welcome home.
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
Any questions?
TRUMAN
(shifting gears, more business-like)
A couple.
CATHERINE
Am I under suspicion?
TRUMAN
I guess that depends on the answers I get. Maybe you'd
like to call your lawyer.
CATHERINE
That won't be necessary. I have nothing to hide.
TRUMAN
Good. For starters, where the hell have you been the past
two weeks?
CATHERINE
Do you believe in guardian angels, Harry?
TRUMAN
Angels? To tell the truth, I'm not so sure what I believe
in anymore.
CATHERINE
(voice gathering emotion)
I believe an angel saved my life.
That gets his attention. Catherine braces herself.
CATHERINE
I was at home the night of the fire. A man called, a






CATHERINE 
voice I didn't recognize. He told me to meet him at the
drying shed. A vague threat was implied. So I went
there. I took a gun. That girl, what was her name?
TRUMAN
Shelly Johnson.
CATHERINE
(a memory steeped in melodrama)
She was tied up inside. A bomb went off. The rest is
just impressions, walls of fire crashing, screams. I have
no idea how I escaped. I came to in the woods. Afraid
for my life. More afraid than I've ever been. I dragged
myself through the dark for what seemed like forever,
not even sure if I was dead or alive. As the sky
lightened, things began to look familiar. The woods. A
path. A rock formation. I was flooded with memories
of my childhood. And I thought, well, this is what
heaven is. That's when I saw our old summer cabin in the
distance. I'd walked twenty miles through the night.
Heaven was Pearl Lakes. And only a guardian angel
could have brought me there.
Catherine pauses to wipe the tears from her eyes. Truman leans to grab a box of tissues.
Occupied, he doesn't see the brief sneer pass across Catherine's features.
CATHERINE
(taking a tissue)
Thank you.
(resuming her artful tale of woe)
We always kept a well-stocked pantry. I went in and
opened a can of tuna fish. And I waited for whoever it
was who had tried to kill me to come and finish the job.
No phone, no newspaper, no television. I tended my
wounds, a loaded gun at my side, terrified that each
moment might be my last.
TRUMAN
(swept away in spite of himself)
Why did you come back?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
I ran out of tuna fish.
A little bit of the old Catherine bleeds through. Sarcasm and superiority. Truman takes a
closer look. Wonders just what she's really thinking. Where she's really been.
CUT TO:

 INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Catherine walks out, just as RICHARD TREMAYNE walks in. He makes a beeline for Lucy.
TREMAYNE
(beaming)
My dove; great news - I've quit smoking!
LUCY
What are you doing here?
TREMAYNE
I wanted to see you. I wanted - to be honest, I wanted to
talk about our bambino.
LUCY
Our bambino?
TREMAYNE
Lucy, I've been in a gnarly turmoil and do you know
what I've discovered? I, Dick Treymayne, am a terrible,
crashing bore. And what I desperately require in my life
is something, no, someone more important than myself to
think about, to care for. So perhaps you see why that
as a result, I must say, parenthood suddenly appeals to me.
Parenthood?

LUCY

TREMAYNE
Fatherhood, more specifically. And since I have no skills
in this area, nurturing is a relatively foreign concept, I've
enlisted myself in the "Happy Helping Hand" program;
part-time big brother to some adorable, homeless waif.
LUCY
Excuse me, are you the Dick Treymayne who works at
Horne's department store?
HAWK walks through reception, glaring at Tremayne.
TREMAYNE
Yes. And, Lucy, by the way, I have absolute confidence
that the child is mine.
Hawk makes a face, sickened. He rounds the corner, and runs smack into DEPUTY ANDY,
who's been listening to all of this. Hawk reacts, but Andy sshushes him. Andy steps into the
lobby, confronting Tremayne and Lucy.






 
ANDY
Lucy, Dick, I have something, I'd like to say.
(pauses, takes a deep breath, nothing comes out)
LUCY
Andy, what is it?
ANDY
I would like to say that we're all in a very difficult
position. I come from a large family. And Mama
always said she couldn't have fussin' and fightin' around
her when she had a bun in the oven. And until we know for
sure who's gonna be throwing that baseball, or building
that doll house we should all be friends.
(extends his hand to a very stunned Tremayne
who finally shakes it - wet noodle style)
So you two go right talk, and I'll see ya.
Lucy and Treymayne stare at each other. Andy backs out of reception and into the hall practically collapsing into Hawk's arms.
HAWK
(hissing whisper)
Andy are you crazy?
ANDY
Hawk, I know Lucy, and I know what'll get her. M orals
and manly behavior.
(pause, an unmanly moment of doubt)
You think I went too far?
They straighten up as Cooper enters past them, carrying fishing gear and goes into Truman's
office.
CUT TO:
 INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE
Truman's making some notes, when Cooper walks in. Truman stands up, smiling.
COOPER
Harry, I guess this is goodbye. There's a frying pan full
of steelhead trout out there with my name on 'em.
TRUMAN
That's why I figure you're gonna be needing this.
Truman picks the PAPER BAG off his desk, and hands it to Cooper; awkward with the
emotion he's feeling. Delighted, Cooper reaches into the bag and pulls out an intricately tied
FISHING FLY - the brightly colored feathers and tinsel, with streamers hanging down.






 
COOPER
It's incredible.
TRUMAN
When those steelhead are running upstream, they're only
thinking about one thing. Sex. A Green Butt Skunk
breaks their concentration.
COOPER
(riveted - holding the fly up, admiring it)
A Green Butt Skunk.
TRUMAN
Tied it myself. My dad taught me how, and his dad
taught him ...
COOPER
(touched)
I don't know what to say ...
TRUMAN
(points to the bag)
There's one more thing.
Cooper reaches in and pulls out a TINY PACKAGE, wrapped in tissue. He opens it,
revealing a small round badge, like a Boy Scout merit badge; an embroidered DOUGLAS
FIR TREE, with a SWORD in its center.
TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys Patch. We all carry it. I talked to
everybody. We feel you're one of us now.
COOPER
Harry, I'm honored beyond any ability I might have to
express myself.
TRUMAN
You wear that ... you ever need us, we'll be there.
Harry extends his hand, Cooper grips it. A pact.
 INT: SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA

CUT TO:

Truman and Cooper walk into the reception area: Hawk, Andy and Lucy are lined up. Like
troops ready for review. Cooper stops, looking at them. Hawk sticks out his hand.



 
COOPER
(shaking his hand)
Hawk. If I'm ever lost, I hope you're the man they send
to find me.
HAWK
May the wind be always at your back.
Cooper moves on to Andy, who's almost in tears.
COOPER
Deputy Andy, your bravery is exceeded only by the size
of your heart. A rare combination indeed.
They shake hands. Andy's too moved to speak. Cooper moves on to Lucy.
COOPER
Lucy, I wish you, and yours, the very best. And I hope
you'll invite me to the wedding, whoever it might be.
They embrace. She sniffles. The front doors fly open and PRESTON KING, a black
Canadian Mountie in full, red uniform marches in. With him is a man who dresses just like
Cooper, SPECIAL AGENT ROGER HARDY.
MOUNTIE
Sheriff Truman?
Yes?

TRUMAN

MOUNTIE
This is Special Agent Roger Hardy of the FBI COOPER
(seeing him, stepping forward)
Hello, Roger, what are you doing here?
HARDY
(tight-lipped)
Dale. We've got a problem. Effective immediately,
without pay, I regret to inform you of your suspension
from the FBI.
ON COOPER'S FACE, ever stoic, we FADE OUT ...
END ACT TWO





ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

Truman sits behind his desk, perturbed. Cooper sits opposite him. The Mountie leans
against the wall, towering over them. Agent Hardy enters.
HARDY
Cooper, I suspect you know why I'm here.
I don't.

TRUMAN (interrupting)

COOPER
(to Truman, re: Hardy)
Internal Affairs.
HARDY
We're the agents who watch the agents.
COOPER
(then to Hardy, re: Mountie)
And his presence refers to my crossing into Canada?
TRUMAN
Now wait a minute, that was directly related to the case
we were investigating.
MOUNTIE
Not without my knowing about it it wasn't.
COOPER
What's the charge, Roger - misfeasance?
Roger nods, serious.
Mis-what?

TRUMAN

COOPER
The improper and unlawful execution of an act that, in
itself, is lawful and proper. The rescue of Audrey Horne.
HARDY
In part. There are also disturbing allegations as to your
motives and your methods.
TRUMAN
What allegations?



 

HARDY
I'm waiting for some evidence to arrive. We'll convene in
one hour.
(then re: Truman)
Alone.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO:

Bobby confronts Ben's SECRETARY otuside his office door.
BOBBY
Did you tell him it's about the tape he got in the mail
yesterday and it's urgent? Would you tell him that
please?
The Secretary rolls her eyes, and goes back inside. Bobby fumes, now pacing, manic. He
doesn't notice Audrey watching him.
AUDREY
A little late for Halloween isn't it?
What?

BOBBY

AUDREY
What are you supposed to be, a lounge lizard?
BOBBY
Shouldn't you be in school?
AUDREY
School numbs my butt. Shouldn't you be?
BOBBY
I'm trying to get an appointment with your father.
AUDREY
What on earth do you want to talk to him about?
BOBBY
A job - business. It's personal.
AUDREY
I didn't know daddy dearest was hiring






 
BOBBY
He will be - I Just need to talk to him first.
AUDREY
(intrigued)
You're up to something, Bobby Briggs. But I'm sure that's
none of my business. Count to ten.
She disappears into her father's office. Bobby's confused but counts anyway.
BOBBY
One ... two ... three ... four ... five ... six ...
The office door opens wide: Audrey smiles, success. Invites him in.
AUDREY
First rule of business is you have to know who to talk to.
BOBBY
(straightening himself up)
Audrey I owe you one.
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

Opera plays on a boom box. Looking slightly disheveled, Ben sits, stocking feet up on the
desk, drinking a milkshake and playing with a weird electronic toy. He doesn't look up.
BOBBY
(business-like demeanor)
Mr. Horne, I know you're a busy man and I respect that
and so I'll get right to the point BEN
I suppose you're here to ask me for Audrey's hand in
marraige or some similar adolescent befuddlement
No.

BOBBY

BEN
(looks at him for the first time)
Well, what then?
Bobby sees the ENVELOPE he mailed Ben, laying unopened on the desk. Bobby picks it up,
rips the seal, and takes out a CASSETTE TAPE.
BEN 
I already have somebody to open my mail, kid.







 
BOBBY
Don't worry; it's from me. This'll just take a second.
Bear with me here, Mr. Horne ...
Bobby nervously tries to fumble the tape into the boom box on Ben's desk. Ben calls on his
intercom.
BEN
Samantha, could you bring in the fly swatter, please?
There's a "bug" in my office.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN HALL/LOBBY - DAY

CUT TO:

Two HOUSE SECURITY MEN escort Bobby out of the hotel. He's been roughed up. In the
lobby, Audrey looks over and sees Bobby pass by, flanked by the thugs.
AUDREY
Bobby! Herman, Donald; I really don't appreciate friends
of mine being treated like this. I may have to speak to
Father about this.
Her eyes shoot daggers. They're afraid of her. They let go of Bobby.
AUDREY (Cont'd)
Run along, boys.
The Thugs move off.
BOBBY
(to Thugs, playing the tough guy)
And you can tell your boss that tape's not the original.
Audrey clocks this last bit of info. She and Bobby walk away, arm-in-arm.
AUDREY
I can't imagine what all this was about.
BOBBY
Audrey, that's twice you've saved my bacon. We could be
talking sainthood. Anything I can do for you?
AUDREY
How about an ice cream?
BOBBY
Cup or cone?






 
AUDREY
Cone. I like to lick.
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

The VIDEOTAPE of Cooper, recorded at One-Eyed Jack's, plays on the TV MONITOR
Hardy and the Mountie sit on one side of the table, Cooper sits on the other.
HARDY
What was the purpose of your first visit to One-Eyed
Jack's?
COOPER
To gather information about the murder of Laura Palmer,
from, this man, Jacques Renault.
HARDY
Who you apparently lured back across the border, where
he was wounded during arrest and subsequently murdered
that night in the hospital.
COOPER
Renault was a material witness to Laura's murder. Leland
Palmer confessed to Jacques' murder, which I believe he
commited to prevent Renault from ever testifying against
him. Are you judging me responsibile for that?
Coooper looks at the Mountie. He takes TWO PHOTOGRAPHS out of a manilla envelope
and tosses them in the middle of the table: one of BLACKIE'S DEAD BODY, the other of
DEAD EMORY BATTIS.
MOUNTIE
Let's talk about your second visit ...
COOPER
To rescue Audrey Horne from her kidnappers.
MOUNTIE
Who both ended up dead.
Hardy gives Mountie a look - he'll handle this.
HARDY
You know procedure. Crossing the border without
contacting Canadian authorities is a serious breach.
Under any circumstances.





 


COOPER
I'm not disputing that. Is it the Bureau's position I'm
responsibile for these deaths?
HARDY
That's what we're trying to determine. This entire
matter has been brought to our attention because Mountie
King was in the middle of a sting operation to nail this
man, Jean Renault.
A photograph of Jean Renault is displayed.
MOUNTIE
We worked six months to set this up; one night you march
in, Renault escapes, these two are dead and the cocaine we
were using to set him up is stolen from the premises.
COOPER
I don't know anything about cocaine. But you've
miscounted; three people were killed., Jean Renault
killed Blackie, I didn't know until now about the Battis
murder. And a bodyguard who turned his gun on me was
killed in self-defense.
Hardy looks at the Mountie - who's been thrown by this.
HARDY
So we've got crossing jurisdictional borders, three dead
bodies and international trafficking of drugs.
COOPER
Roger, I admit to the border crossing. You already know
the extent of my involvement with the killings. I hope
you know me better than to suspect I'd have any part of a
drug transaction.
HARDY
(eyes boring holes)
I won't know that until you prove it, Cooper. I will tell
you DEA's been called in to investigate. And you've got
twenty-four hours to assemble your defense; in the
meantime I'll require that you surrender your gun and
badge.
Pause. Cooper removes his GUN from the shoulder holster, and lays it on the table. From his
shirt pocket he produces the case containing his BADGE, places it next to his gun. Hardy nods
to the Mountie; he opens the door, summons Truman in, who's waiting just outside. Truman
sees Cooper's badge and gun. Cooper stands, smiles at Harry. He walks out, head high.





(2)



HARDY
(motioning to a chair)
Sheriff, I'll need to ask you a few questions.
I'll stand.

TRUMAN

HARDY
Let me begin by saying that whatever Agent Cooper is
guilty of will not be held against you; your cooperation
will be very useful - and greatly appreciated by the FBI.
TRUMAN
If I understand the law correctly, you (to Mountie)
need extradition papers in order to get a statement from
me. And you (to Hardy) need a subpeona from a judge.
Unless either of you have the appropriate paperwork you can take my cooperation and stuff It.
HARDY
That attitude will not serve you or Agent Cooper TRUMAN
It's not an attitude, it's a promise. I've had nothing, but
respect for the FBI since the day Cooper walked into my
office. He's the finest law man I've ever known; check
that, the finest man period. I don't know what
information you have or where you got it from, but I can
tell you this ... it's dead wrong
Truman turns on his heels and walks out.
 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

CUT TO:

CLOSE ON an animated TEENAGE GIRL'S FACE - cheering.
CHEERING GIRL
STEEPLEJACKS, STEEPLEJACKS, ROLL 'EM!!!!
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS. Nadine is next in the line of
AUDITIONING GIRLS. The P.E. TEACHER and Vice Principal Greege sit behind a
table, judging. Behind them hangs a BANNER for the "Twin Peaks Steeplejacks".
TWO WRESTLERS work out in another corner of the gym, under the WRESTLING
COACH'S supervision.
The Cheering Girl finishes off with a big jump in the air, touching both toes. The Pep Squad
applauds. Nadine is waved forward and eagerly approaches the JUDGES' TABLE.



 



NADINE
Nadine Butler.

Greege nods to the P.E. Teacher, who, trying to act normal, writes this down.
P.E. TEACHER
I'll need your permission slip, please, Nadine.
NADINE
(smile fading)
Permission?
P.E. TEACHER
Signed by your parents.
NADINE
Oh. My parents are in Europe.
TWO GIRLS in the line snicker. Greege intervenes.
GREEGE
She's okay. I've spoken. to her hus - to her guardian.
Nadine brightens.
P.E. TEACHER
Alright, Nadine, let's start you off with tumbling
Nadine bounces over to center stage. A MALE CHEERLEADER stands by to spot her. He
rolls his eyes - condescending. Nadine, grinning ear-to-ear, walks backwards. Further and
further, as if this were her routine. We HEAR a few laughs.
With a little jump, she starts running forward, and does a FRONT FLIP, followed by another
FRONT DOUBLE FLIP, into a series of CARTWHEELS, landing right in front or the
aghast MALE CHEERLEADER. She picks him up by his waist and tosses him into the air.
Corkscrew!

NADINE

And he indeed SPINS through the air, across the gym, landing on the matt on top of the
wrestlers. The Coach looks from the hapless cheerleader over to Nadine - very impressed.
Nadine beams proudly, barely out of breach.
 INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

SHELLY'S in the kitchen, brushing LEO'S teeth with an electric toothbrush. The whirring
produces quite a bit of foam around Leo's mouth, running down his chin. The PHONE
RINGS.






 
SHELLY
(still brushing)
I'm not answering (RINGS again)
No! All day, not one word.
It RINGS again, and this time Shelly turns off the toothbrush, slamming it down on the
counter. She hops over Leo and answers the phone.
SHELLY 
Johnson's Nursing Home.
(listening, hurt)
Well that's just great, Bobby. I'm glad things went so
well. This must've been the longest meeting, in history.
CAMERA MOVES down, shooting Shelly through the spokes of Leo's wheelchair.
SHELLY 
Yes, I still love you. Bobby, I've been thinking, we're
really gonna have to put Leo somewhere - in a home.
The wheel of Leo's chair turns one full revolution, rolling slowly through the frame, and stops.
SHELLY 
It's not worth it. I don't want the money. I want a life.
Shelly turns and starts to sit; stops, looking at Leo. Something's wrong, but she can't place it.
SHELLY 
Bobby, I think he moved. I swear, Leo moved.
(listening)
Okay, maybe I am losing my mind. That's what I've
been trying to tell you. Get over here tomorrow, first
thing. Please. Bye, lover.
Shelly hangs up, and goes over to Leo - the foam still hanging from his mouth - looking quite
mad. Shelly looks at where she thought the chair was, and where it is now. Could it be? She
shakes her head. A long day. Shelly moves around in front of Leo, peering cautiously into his
eyes.
SHELLY
Leo Johnson, are you in there?
Nothing. Shelly turns away, reaching for a towel. As Leo BLOWS A BUBBLE.
FADE OUT:

ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 INT. DINER - NIGHT
Cooper sits in a booth, drinking coffee, and studying a small PORTABLE CHESS BOARD,
wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. Truman walks in, relieved to see Cooper, sits opposite.
TRUMAN
Who are you playing, with?
COOPER
Windom Earle. A formidable opponent.

Cooper moves his pawn, then writes his move down on a piece of paper. He puts the note in an
ENVELOPE, already addressed to Windom Earle, Personals Dept., USA TODAY.
TRUMAN
I've been looking all over for you.
COOPER
I went to the library. Took a walk. I got hungry.
TRUMAN
What was at the library?
COOPER
William O. Douglas. A man from this neck of the
woods, and one of the great ministers of justice. I was
seeking, inspiration and I found it there.
TRUMAN
Preparing your defense?
COOPER
Yes. Douglas said in times of trouble a man should
immerse himself in wilderness. I'm going fishing.
(rises, lays his money on the counter)
You know, Harry, somewhere between William
Douglas and the Dalai Lama lies the perfect man.
Their attention is drawn to Norma, angrily folding up all the tableclothes and dumping them
in a box behind the counter.
COOPER 
Norma appears to be quite upset this evening.
TRUMAN
That damn food critic finally wrote a review. Ran this
afternoon in the Seattle paper.






 
That bad?

COOPER

TRUMAN
To call it scathing would be kind.
Cooper reaches for his check. Truman takes it.
TRUMAN
Let me. I'm the one who still has a paycheck.
COOPER
Harry, you're aces. Excuse me.
(rises, moves to Norma)
Norma? You know what they say? A critic is a legless
man who teaching running.
NORMA
(devastated)
Did you read it?
COOPER
It doesn't matter; you couldn't keep people out of here if
you tried.
NORMA
You're very nice, to say so. Thanks.
(as Cooper and Truman head for the door)
Harry, is it hunting season?
TRUMAN
Not unless they've switched months on the calender.
Norma chews that over. Cooper and Truman exit.
COOPER
Harry, it's time to put that Green Butt Skunk to work.
They exit, passing Vivian just entering. She moves to Norma at the cash register.
VIVIAN
What's happened to the tablecloths?
NORMA
The critic has spoken. I feel like a fool.
VIVIAN
Darling, pick your lower lip up off the floor. It wasn't
that bad.







 (2)
NORMA
Mother, don't tell me how to feel. This business is all I
have. I just want to keep my regular customers. I don't
care if anyone else ever comes here again. And they won't;
not after "if you're looking for local color stop in, but for
good food - give this one a wide berth."
VIVIAN
It said "local charm," not color.
NORMA
What did you do, memorize the piece of crash?
VIVIAN
No. I wrote it.
Pause.
VIVIAN 
You might as well know so we can get this particular
melodrama over with. M. T. Wentz, c'est moi.
NORMA
I can't belive it. Is that why you came to visit. To run
me into the ground?
VIVIAN
Norma, darling, I wanted to write a good review, but it's
just not a good restaurant. I can't violate my professional
ethics NORMA
Ethics? I'm your daughter VIVIAN
Some standards have to prevail over NORMA
What about standards for common decency? Kindness?
Or don't those fall within the standards of your
"profession" VIVIAN
Of course they do NORMA
No, the proof's in the pudding. Even if you find it
inedible. I wouldn't treat a dog like this, much less my
own daughter.




 (3)



VIVIAN
As usual, you're over-reacting NORMA
Am I? Maybe I am. But it's my reaction. I'm the one
who's hurt here and how I react is none of your damn
business VIVIAN
Dear, be sensible NORMA
I am being sensible. Leave this place, now and get out of
my life. I 'm not going to lei you hurt me anymore.
Norma -

VIVIAN

NORMA
Goodbye. Go.
She stares at her. Vivian grows cold and leaves. Norma pours herself a cup of coffee. Tears
fall, her hands shake, rattling the cup but she knows she turned a corner.
 INT. ONE-EYED JACK'S - BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Hank and Ernie, still in hunting attire with rifles, are escorted in by a couple of PICK-UPS.
HANK
(giving the girls some chips)
Thanks, kids. We'll take it from here.

Bagged our limit today, Ern, without firing a shot.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.
ERNIE
I'll remind you I'm a married man. Recently married.
HANK
To an extremely wealthy woman. And as we discussed
we're real eager to get into business with you ERNIE
I will not steal my wife's money!
HANK
Stealing? Who said anything about stealing? You're the
computer whiz, old buddy, hit the keyboard, she won't




 


HANK 
even see a ripple in the pond. Look at it this way, Ernie,
if you don't help us, how long do you think she's going to
be your wife?
(Hank has him in half-serious headlock)
Vivian will throw you out of the house, then my partner
will kill you. So I suggest you get with the program,
pal.
Jean enters silently. He looks at Ernie, not liking what he sees.
This is him?

JEAN

HANK
(turning to present Ernie)
Ernie, meet Jean Renault. Met him in the woods one
night when he stuck a gun in my ear. Lucky for me I had
my state prosecutor's badge with me. Don't leave home
without it.
(Ernie pales, this isn't funny)
Jean, this is the Professor. What he can do with numbers
could make a thousand dollar hooker blush like a nun.
JEAN
(to Ernie, laying it out)
A recent investment opportunity fell through, leaving us
in a cash-poor position. We need $125,0 Immediately.
ERNIE
(realizing the fix he's in; lying)
I understand completely.
JEAN
Do you, Professor?
ERNIE
(inspired lying)
This, this will not be difficult. Just so you know a little
bit more about me, I've been associated with a number
of the most prestigious financial institutions in the
country; I've laundered massive amounts of money, I've
brokered tremendously large deals for the Columbian
and Bolivian industries. In other words, I'm wired in.
Hard-wired I'm your man. Definitely. Definitely your
man.


JEAN
(cheering up)
You said the magic words.
Jean turns around and walks out. Ernie looks at Hank - is this it, I'm a goner?
HANK
Nicely done, Ernie. Are you making this up?


 (2)


ERNIE
(of course he is)
No, no, no, no.
Jean returns, bringing with him Sergeant King, the Mountie, now in civilian dress. He carries a
briefcase.
JEAN
(to Mountie, re: Ernie)
The Professor. Our new broker.
The Mountie lays out his briefcase, opens it, revealing multiple KILOS of COCAINE.
Ernie's eyes bug out. Hank pats him on the back.
HANK
You can handle this puny little load, can't you Ernie?
JEAN
(showing the pistol in his belt)
He'll take care of it for us - won't you Professor?
ERNIE
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
JEAN
Hank, take the Professor down to the tables. I understand
you have quite a system; roulette, craps. Very scientific.
ERNIE
I did, I used to, I don't, I don't gamble anymore.
JEAN
We're all gamblers here, Professor. Enjoy life.
A nod to Hank, who quickly ushers Ernie out.
MOUNTIE
I don't like the look of him.
JEAN
We'll see, won't we?
(removing one kilo)
Four for us, one to put the last nail in Cooper's coffin.
MOUNTIE
(taking the key)
I'll call you when it's done.

JEAN
Where will you put it?
MOUNTIE
His car. We won't need much. A trace.
JEAN
I want him crucified.
The Mountie nods. Exits. Stay on jean.
 EXT. HARRY TRUMAN'S LOG CABIN HOUSE - NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO:

Establish.
 INT. HARRY TRUMAN'S - NIGHT

CUT TO:

A SOUND outside. Truman sits bolt up right in bed. He listens. Hears footsteps. He takes
his pistol from the holster hanging on the headboard, moves cautiously towards the door in the
darkness. He sees a shadow of movement outside the window against a curtain. Then a rattle
at the door, someone trying the handle.
Hefting the gun, Truman moves to the door, stands to the side, then pulls the door open
inwards. JOSIE PACKARD falls into the room, into his arms. She's exhausted, faint, a
wound on her forehead.
Josie ...
Help me ...

TRUMAN
JOSIE

She slips into unconsciousness. He holds her.
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Surrounded by towering Douglas Firs, Cooper and Major Briggs sit by their campfire putting MARSHMALLOWS on sticks. FISHING GEAR dries against a tree. The remains
of their dinner, TROUT BONES and HEADS, lay on tin plates.
COOPER
Major this is a fascinating concept. The other side of
love is not hate - but fear?






 
MAJOR BRIGGS
Absolutely. And fear is the absence of love.
COOPER
For yourself as well.
MAJOR BRIGGS
All perceptions or conditions must begin with the self.
They put their marshmallows over the fire.
COOPER
So when I let fear into my life, I'm not loving myself.
MAJOR BRIGGS
You are in direct contradiction to a state of loving
acceptance; incapable of it. Direct denial.
COOPER
Major Briggs, if I may ask a personal question ... do you
love yourself?
Very much.

MAJOR BRIGGS

Cooper's fascinated. He rotates his marshmallow in the fire.
COOPER
Then it stands to reason that Leland Palmer didn't.
MAJOR BRIGGS
One could draw that conclusion. There are powerful
forces of evil in the world. It is some men's fate to
confront great darkness. We each choose how to react. If
the choice is fear, then we become vulnerable to darkness.
Cooper looks around, at the literal darkness surrounding him.
COOPER
Tomorrow I face my own demons, Major Briggs. But,
thanks to you, I believe I will do so without fear. I
carefully considered my actions before proceeding. I
went forward. I must accept the consequences.
MAJOR BRIGGS
You can do no more.
An owl hoots somewhere in the woods. They look for it. A reflective pause.






 (2)
COOPER
Major, I think about "Bob." If he truly exists.
MAJOR BRIGGS
I have pondered the some question continuously since this
horror was revealed to us.
COOPER
I try to imagine him, "it", out there somewhere, lurking.
Searching for prey. Terrible.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes. But remember, we have a choice; to think about it in
that way, to fear it, imparts power to evil. There are ways
to resist. You, Sir, are blessed with certain gifts. In this
respect you are not alone. Have you ever heard of the
White Lodge?
COOPER
(takes a bite of marshmellow)
The White Lodge. No.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Excuse me, mine is now seared to perfection.
Briggs pops the whole blackened marshmallow into his mouth. Cooper rises.
COOPER
I'll be right back, Major. Call of nature. There's nothing
quite like urinating in the open air. I look forward to
hearing about the White Lodge.
The Major, his mouth full, gives a "thumbs up."
 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Cooper moves behind a tree to urinate. An OWL SCREECHES.
ON THE TREE BRANCHES above him, two luminous EYES shine out of the darkness.
Cooper heads back to camp. There's another OWL SCREECH - much louder, more chilling.
And between him and campsite, a flash of WHITE LIGHT.
 MAJOR BRIGGS

INTERCUT:

Looking into the white light - surrounding a TALL, DARK, CLOAKED FIGURE, face
obscured by a cowled hood.




 
Cooper!

MAJOR BRIGGS

Cooper hurries back to camp, fighting fear with every step.
COOPER
Major? Major Briggs?
He stops. A new marshmallow is on Briggs' stick, laying in the fire. The MARSHMALLOW
IGNITES. Briggs is gone. Cooper looks up, past the fire, toward the white light that first
drew the Major's attention.
MAJOR?

COOPER

Cooper runs toward the light, up a dark hill. But as he nears it, the light suddenly goes out.
HOLD ON Cooper for a beat.

INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE
ANGLE ON MRS. BRIGGS, sitting in a chair facing TRUMAN and COOPER.
MRS. BRIGGS
I don't want to alarm you overly. Garland has
disappeared before. Granted it's always been work
related. Agent Cooper, did this seem work related?
COOPER
M'am, that's very hard to say.
TRUMAN
So Betty you're saying this behavior is part of the way the
Major operates.
MRS. BRIGGS
Let me ask you this: did he leave suddenly?
COOPER
Yes. We were speaking philosophically. Then I left the
site to answer a call of nature. He was gone when I
returned.
MRS. BRIGGS
The fact that you were in the woods is very significant.
TRUMAN
In what way?
MRS. BRIGGS
All I know is he talks about them constantly.
COOPER
In what way?








MRS. BRIGGS
(all she'll offer)
Confidential ways.

TRUMAN
(a look at Cooper)
Betty, I'm afraid there's not much we can do now except
keep an eye out. He can't be considered legally missing
until after 24 hours.
COOPER
Be patient, Mrs. Briggs. Your husband has a renaissance
passion for exploration. That approach creates its own
schedules.
MRS. BRIGGS
That is how he sees himself. There's no manual for it;
there's also no manual for being married to it.
(stands)
Garland left some brief notes on his nightstand. I'll call
you back with them.
TRUMAN
That might be helpful.
She exits.
COOPER
Harry, Major Briggs didn't wander off on some work
assignment. That flash of light I saw signified a power; a
force that lives in those woods.
ANDY BRENNAN and HAWK enter carrying a small white department store box.
ANDY
Sheriff, we found Mr. and Mrs. Milford their wedding
gifts. It's a matching scarf and ascot set.
Andy digs into the white box and pulls out two loud, almost road-kill plaid scarves.
HAWK
Can't believe he's getting married again.
TRUMAN
We should just recycle gifts from the last wedding.
HAWK
(to Cooper)
Dougie's weddings are a seasonal thing. Like the return
of the salmon.

COOPER
Marry in haste, repent in leisure.

The INTERCOM sounds.
INTERCOM (WOMAN)
There's a call for a Dale Crewper ... long distance. Hope
I didn't cut it off.

TRUMAN

Truman flips on the speaker phone. A moment passes. GORDON COLE.
COLE (PHONE)
HARRY, COOP? ARE WE THERE? THIS IS
GORDON COLE CALLING FROM BEND,
OREGON.
COOPER
We know, Gordon. How are you?
COLE
COOP, I JUST CALLED TO SAY THAT YOU
HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT IN THIS
INVESTIGATION BUSINESS. THESE ARE
HARD TIMES. WE GET THROUGH THEM.
COOPER
Thanks, Gordon.
COLE
IT RANKS POOR WITH ME, TOO. NOW COOP,
IS ANY OF THIS TRUE? DOUBLE HOMOCIDE?
STOLEN DRUGS? STORMING A
WHOREHOUSE?
COOPER
Gordon, it's a bunch of hogwash
COLE

ENFORCEMENT AGENCY'S STARTING TO

COLE

COOPER

COLE

COOPER
(primarily to Truman)
He's a good man, Harry. No nonsense.

Under which, HAWK enters.
HAWK
Cooper, they're ready for you in the hearing.
COOPER
That's it, Gordon. TIME TO FACE THE MUSIC.
COLE
DON'T LET'EM RATTLE YOU, COOP. THESE
GUYS MAKE A LIVING LOOKING THROUGH
OTHER PEOPLE'S DRAWERS. WE'VE ALL HAD
OUR SOCKS TOSSED AROUND. CATCH YOU
LATER.
Cole hangs up without fan fare. Cooper returns the receiver. Exchanges a look with Truman.
Wish me luck. CUT TO:


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
Sitting at the conference table is ROGER HARDY. On each side of him are TWO MEN in
slate suits, with eyes as even as colored water. Before Hardy is an open folder, Cooper's
badge, I.D. and gun. Cooper enters, closes the door and sits down. On the table between him
and these three men sit three dark blue fedora hats.
Roger.

COOPER

HARDY
Dale.
A beat. The two underlings sit as still as bookends.
HARDY (CONT'D)
Showtime, Agent Cooper. You've heard the charges.









HARDY (CONT'D)
What do you wish to present in your defense?
COOPER
I have no defense.
The two operatives look over at Hardy, who stares inquisitively at Cooper. The man on
Hardy's left, whose job it is to record testimony, tentatively takes down this response.
COOPER (CONT'D)
I'm completely confident in the rightness of my actions.
Some of it went down outside bureau stipulations, yes, I
accept that and I'll pay the price. But I'm innocent of
any criminal wrong doing. If they wish to charge me I'll
defend myself in a court of law.
HARDY
(to the man on his left)
Close the book.
(he does so; Hardy to Cooper)
Dale, there's a right way and a wrong way to do this. And
the first thing we expect a bureau man to do is stand up
for himself. A man who can't, who doesn't even try, may
be packing feathers where his spine's supposed to be.
COOPER
Roger, I know the move I'm supposed to make. And I
know the board.

So ...

HARDY
(palms turned upward)

COOPER
I've done a lot of thinking. And I've started to focus out
beyond the end of the board. On a bigger game.
HARDY
(losing patience)
What 'game'?
COOPER
The sound wind makes through the pines. The sentience
of animals. The last thought of a homeless man before he
takes a night's sleep. What we fear in the dark. And
what's beyond the dark.
HARDY
What the hell are you talking about?





(2)




COOPER
I'm talking about seeing beyond fear, Roger. About
looking at the world with love.
HARDY
Cooper, you're liable to be extradited for murder and
drug trafficking COOPER
That's something I can't control HARDY
(hard stare)
Your suspension will continue in force. The next moves
are the Canadian government's and a DEA investigation,
which begins today.
(a slight softening)
You've cracked a big case. You've been under a lot of
pressure. I may recommend a full psychological work-up.
COOPER
(rises, pleasantly)
Thank you for your candor, Roger. So long fellas.
Cooper stands, looks over at his gun, badge and I.D. card, and starts away. ANGLE ON
those objects, still sitting on the table, as we HEAR the door shut.

INT. WEIGHT ROOM
Now changed into his wrestling sweats, Mike joins other TEAM MEMBERS gathered around
the weight machines, exchanging a few perfunctory greetings before going over to a seat at the
leg press machine. Hyperventilating in preparation, he looks up at his buddies, who are
looking back at him with curiously broad adolescent grins.
His sudden premonition of dread is answered by the bluejeaned figure dropping down into the
neighboring machine seat; she sets the weight before allowing herself to peek over.
Hi, Mike.

NADINE







Mike turns his head in dismay. He is both supremely irritated by, and unequipped to deal
with, this bizarre new shadow in his life. The guys are choking back amusement.
Hello.

MIKE

NADINE
(on a roll)
How are you?
MIKE
Just great. Listen, is there something you want?
NADINE
Now, Mike ... aren't we being a little forward?
Nonplussed, Mike starts working the leg extensions. It's all Nadine can do to keep her eyes
off him. With the half-hearted dissemblance of a schoolgirl, she also starts doing leg presses;
but she is doing them with six hundred pounds of weight.
The guys have stopped kidding. The room is virtually silent but for the lifting and pounding
down of weight when the WRESTLING COACH robustly enters.
COACH
Thattaway, Nelson ... I keep telling you guys, it's leg
power that wins matches ....
He then pulls up to a stunned shuffle, seeing the magazine next to Mike's is hoisting double the
weight. Being a coach, he is quick to recover.
COACH 
And what's your name, little lady?
NADINE
(belle of the weight room)
Nadine Butler.
COACH
Tell me, Nadine ...
(big grin)
... ever give any thought to going out for the wrestling
team?
ANGLE ON Mike: will there be no escape from this girl?


EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DAY

CUT TO:

Establish. On a barren stretch of the Interstate. A shoebox along the highwayside, with a sunlit
neon shingle that reads, "The Broken Bones". Parked in the foreground is an old white Corvette
convertible with a weather-worn red interior.




INT. ROADSIDE BAR
Dark. Near empty. Clearly a place that lives on night receipts and stray afternoon beers. The
BARTENDER steals a glance over at his only customer, an intent, demure BLONDE in a
purple silk jacket, mid-twenties. A wistful sadness clings to her like perfume.
JAMES HURLEY enters, takes a seat two down and orders a beer. It arrives. The bartender
fades into the background. James takes a long first drink, aware he's being watched.
Hi.

WOMAN

He moves his head a quarter turn, sees her through one eye and looks back into his beer.
H'lo.

JAMES

She kills the rest of a tequila, ice. There's another waiting beside it:
WOMAN
Headed somewhere?
I'm sorry?

JAMES

WOMAN
Is is someplace you're going or running from?
JAMES
You got it all wrong. I'm alright.
WOMAN
Men are always alright. Right up until they pull the
trigger.
The bartender snorts his amusement. Her return look pushes him further into the background.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Then the neighbors march solemnly out to the news
cameras to tell us, "He was such a nice, quiet guy."
JAMES
I'm only quiet on the outside.
WOMAN
I can almost hear what's inside from here.
He relapses into a characteristic silence; feeling she's been a little harsh on this stranger, her
manner softens.







 
WOMAN
There was a woman involved.
JAMES
A few of them. Actually.
WOMAN
So you were outnumbered. We don't fight fair.
(ice against glass)
'Live nearby?
JAMES
Twin Peaks.
(meaning her eyes:)
That's a nice jacket.
WOMAN
(dismissingly)
I'm glad you think so. Can you ... do anything with cars?
JAMES
Sure. 'Having problems with that Corvette?
WOMAN
No. While he was away on business, I foolishly took my
husband's Dusenburg out on the road. Someone squeezed
me on the highway, I ran it into a ditch. It would be a
very good idea for me to have the car repaired before my
husband, comes home.
JAMES
I could take a look.
(sips for courage)
My name's James.
WOMAN
Evelyn. Evelyn Marsh.
(sips for pleasure)
I live just up the road.
In the silence, he hears her legs crossing under the bar.
JAMES
We in a hurry?
(she smiles, shakes her head)
Mind if I play the box first?




(2)
EVELYN
(slides him down a quarter)
I don't exactly punch a clock, myself.
James slowly steps over to the jukebox. Something about this offer feels like more than it says
it is. He puts on a slow, soulful song about a wasted, violet life.
As James stands in the jukebox light looking for his next selection, the CAMERA recedes,
leaving them to the music, the dark empty bar, the bartender cleaning glasses.

TREMAYNE entering with 'little brother', NICKY, a wide-eyed vulnerable-looking little
boy. Both are staring at the gun, which Andy holsters then extends a greeting to rival suitor.
ANDY
Good day, Dick.
TREMAYNE
Hello, Andy. This is Little Nicky, my charge from
Happy Helping Hand. Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.
ANDY
How do you do, young fella.
Hi.

NICKY

TREMAYNE
Andrew, old boy, Nicky and I just stopped off at
Horne's for a new wardrobe, we're just on our way for a
malted and we were hoping Lucy could join us.
ANDY
Oh shoot, Dick, Lucy's up at the Great Northern today
helping with the Milford wedding.
TREYMAYNE
Oh God,. that 's right; Dougie's getting married again.
NICKY
Lucy's not here?
TREMAYNE
Yes, unfortunately we'll have to meet Lucy another time.
Nicky realizes his dread: another abandonment. He looks up anxiously.
NICKY
But you, you promised. Where is she?
TREMAYNE
I'm afraid Lucy's very busy right now and doesn't have
time for us.
More resonance. The child begins lightly, silently crying. This is too much for Andy.







 
ANDY
You know, Dick this is just about my lunch hour ... and if
you'd like, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy taking you two guys out
for a malted. How would that be?
NICKY

Oh boy!
A look of gratitude, mixed with a little suspicion from Treymayne.

Hawk and Truman enter to find Cooper, pouring coffee from a pitcher on Truman's desk.
COOPER
(pouring himself some coffee)
Harry. Nine years ago I joined the bureau because I felt
it was the strongest statement I could make about the man
I wanted to become and the world I wanted to live in.
And now, suddenly all that's brushed aside. I have
absolutely no responsiblities. Nothing to do. And it
feels ...
(laser-eyed delight)
... fantastic.
Cooper sips from his cup. Looks up at Truman with a disbelieving stare; then suddenly spits
coffee halfway across the room. Truman shakes his head in amusement.
TRUMAN
Temp. Lucy's helping out with the Milford wedding.
COOPER
(putting down the cup)
Sorry about that.
TRUMAN
That's alright. We still need to clean up Hawk's.
Drain water.

HAWK






10A. 
TRUMAN
Coop ... what will you do if you can't clear yourself?

COOPER
Harry, last night, Major Briggs planted a seed in my
mind. And it's been germinating. The idea that by
focusing on our fears or desires about something, we give
them tremendous power. Consider this, Harry: perhaps
by our best-intentioned resistance of evil, we somehow
unknowingly join hands with it. Perpetuate it.
(he has lost the sheriff)
And now, being suspended, I'm suddenly empowered to
let go of my preoccupation with wrongdoing. I feel like
I've been exiled back to the natural rhythms of life.
TRUMAN
Well, if you ever come to feel you need a home base,
there'll always be a job for you here in Twin Peaks.
COOPER
(with emphatic gratitude)
Harry, in a world of continuing disorder, you are a rock.
Oh, Mrs. Briggs called. The notes beside Major Briggs's
bed? A rather detailed grocery list and a small
endearment. Nothing more.
(his eyes light up)
Hawk, Harry have either of you ever heard of a place
called the White Lodge.
TRUMAN
Can't say that I have.
Hawk's initial reply is a look of concern.
HAWK
Where did you hear of it?
COOPER
It was the last thing Major Briggs mentioned before he
disappeared. You know of it?
HAWK
(a cautious look at Harry)
Cooper, you may be fearless in this world. But there are
other worlds.
COOPER
Tell me more.







10A. (2)
HAWK
Local legend. The White Lodge is a place where the
spirits that rule man and nature here reside.
COOPER
That's a place I'd like to see.
HAWK
Many have tried. They say it exists only on the spiritual
plane.
TRUMAN
(sitting; here we go again)
Maybe I'd better pull up a chair.
HAWK
There is also a legend of a place called The Black Lodge:
the shadow self of the White Lodge, a place of dark
forces that pull on this world. A world of nightmares:
shamans reduced to crying children; angry spirits pouring
from the woods; graves opening like flowers.
Dangerous.

COOPER

HAWK
The legend says every spirit must pass through there on
the path to perfection. There you will meet your own
shadow self. My people call it the Dweller on the
Threshold. But it is said that if you confront the Black
Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate
your soul.
COOPER
Holy Smokes.
Just then: an intercom BUZZ. The temp's vaguely confused VOICE is heard:
TEMP'S VOICE
Agent Crewper? Agent Bryson here to see you.
COOPER
(to Hawk and Truman)
Dennis and I worked together in Oakland a couple years
back. Broke a smuggling ring. One of the finest minds in
the DEA, Harry. We're in good hands.







10A. (3)
A KNOCK is heard. All turn toward the door.
Coop?

MAN (O.S.)

They look up: leaning fetchingly against the doorframe is a thin MAN in an Ann Taylor suit.
Long skirt. Light makeup.
... Dennis?

COOPER

MAN IN DRESS
It's a long story, but I prefer Denise if you don't mind.
COOPER
Okay. This is Sheriff Truman. Deputy Hawk.
DENISE
Pleased. Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency.
Oblivious to the stares, Bryson sits and opens his briefcase. He is clearly business first.
DENISE (CONT'D)
Nice ride out here ... hard to believe you even have any
crime, Sheriff, I picture you chasing lost dogs, locking
up the town drunk ...
TRUMAN
It's a little more involved.
DENISE
Let's move right through this, Dale. The DEA's interest
stems from allegations made by an RCMP officer that
you stole drugs being used by him in a sting operation.
COOPER
Patently untrue: Denise, I believe I'm being set up.

DENISE
My recent experience has taught me never to judge too
quickly.
(closes briefcase)
I'll get right to work on this and be back to you later
today. I understand we're both staying at the Great

No.

DONNA

NADINE

Oh, yea.
Why?

DONNA

NADINE
You have to promise to say anything, promise, okay?
(Donna nods)
I think there may be some major chemistry developing ...
omi God, there he is.
Mike approaches, Nadine hurries to him, girlishly leans into his path.
NADINE
Hi, Mike. Guess who's thinking about going out for the
wrestling team?
Donna looks over at Mike; this can't be true. Wrestling? Mike shrugs back in the affirmative.
NADINE (CONT'D)
I promise to take it easy on you in practice.
Mike, who's had enough, smiles acidly and moves on. Nadine watches hungrily.
NADINE (CONT'D)
Look at those buns. Cowabunga.
DONNA
Nadine ... what about Ed?
(a blank stare)
Aren't you ... still seeing him?
Yeah, sorta.

NADINE

DONNA
Well ... if you're seeing Ed, how can you, you know, start
seeing Mike?
NADINE

Ed's at home. Mike's at school. Ed stays in. Mike likes
to go out. And let's be realistic. Sometimes Ed acts like
he's old enough to be my father. Catch you later.

JOSIE'S sitting up in bed, finishing her lunch. Truman sits at her bedside.
TRUMAN
All right. It's time you tell me where you've been and
what you've been through. I have to know the truth. I
can't go on doing this, being with you unless I know.
JOSIE
(stroking his face)
Harry ...
He takes her hand gently but firmly away from his face.
The truth.

TRUMAN

JOSIE
(pause, completely different tone)
I used to work for a man in Hong Kong. His name is
Thomas Eckhardt. He ... helped me. He took me off the
streets when I was sixteen. If you're from a poor family,
sometimes they ... sell the female children. I was lucky.
Truman struggles to keep his emotional resolve.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
He taught me about life and he taught me about business.
He was my father. My master. My lover. I never
questioned him or anything he did. Then a day came
when I learned too much. He had a man killed, a business
partner who had wronged him. Murdered. I saw it done.
TRUMAN
Did you go to the police?





 
JOSIE
He owns the police. When I met Andrew Packard I was
already afraid for my life. Andrew was also a business
partner. He was good and kind, and when he asked me to
marry him, I said yes, to come with him, and to get away
from Eckhardt.
TRUMAN
Who was this Mr. Lee? Your "cousin?"
JOSIE
Harry, I'm sorry. I was trying to keep you out of this.
The less you know the better Who was he?

TRUMAN

JOSIE
That man works for Eckhardt. And he said if I didn't go
back with him he would kill you.
Why?

TRUMAN

JOSIE
Because Eckhardt wants me. He's never stopped wanting
me. He think I'm his property. When Andrew was alive
he could protect me. I now believe Eckhardt is the man
responsible for Andrew's death.
(pauses, makes sure Truman's buying - he is)
Jonathan was driving me to the airport in Seattle. I
jumped out of the car. I'd rather die. I'd rather die than
go back to that monster ...
TRUMAN
Josie, stop. You're here with me.
JOSIE
(tearing up)
Now he'll kill both of us.
Truman takes her in his arms. Quiet. Determined.
Let him try.

ACT THREE




FADE IN:
 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
Andy, Tremayne, and Little Nicky sit together at the counter. Nicky seated angelically,
between them. Norma enters, pours a refill, spots a new customer seated nearby. Roger
Hardy looks up from his newspaper.
NORMA
May I help you?
HARDY
(business-like as usual)
I'd like a cup of coffee, please. And some of that pie I
keep hearing about.
NORMA
(friendly)
Coming up. You won't be disappointed.
Norma turns to go. But familiar voices catch her attention. HANK and ERNIE enter,
singing a hunting song, spirited and sleepless from the expedition. Ernie looks far the more
worn; he as clearly had his clock cleaned by a thorough professional.
HANK
Hello, sunshine. Can we get some coffee?
Hank drifts toward the back, Ernie drops onto a counter seat, where Norma immediately
draws him some coffee. Ernie trombones into a handkefchief.
NORMA
How was the hunting expedition? Catch anything?
HANK
(sotto voce)
Hope not.
ERNIE
Catch anything? I came across a twelve-point buck
standing by a deepwater stream; looked me right in the
eye, wouldn't budge. Almost like he was toying with
me. I made a soft approach, lined him up dead center
and...
("shoots")
A steady eye. A steady hand. That's the secret.
She hands him his coffee, smelling more bourbon on him than bush. Knows he's lying.





20 A.

 
NORMA
You should have taken along a camera. Is it being
mounted?
ERNIE
Ah ... yes, probably as we speak. It was great. Just great.
(uncomfortably caught in the lie, stands)
Well, I'm going back to check in on your momma.
NORMA
She went back to Seattle.
Seattle?

ERNIE

NORMA
(genuine concern)
That's where you should go, too.



 
Hank returns from the back. Ernie pulls away from Norma.




NORMA 
Take care, Ernie.
HANK
Hey, buddy, what's with the long puss.
ERNIE
Vivian's gone back to Seattle.
HANK
Better for you, buckeroo. You've got four kilos to unload,
you don't want the ball and chain getting in the way, do you?
ERNIE
I suppose not.
HANK
Better hit the phones, Hot Rod. We're on a deadline.
Ernie starts unenthusiastically toward the pay phone; Hank heads back to the kitchen. PICK
UP Norma as she delivers their orders to little Nicky, Andy and Treymayne.
NORMA
Two coffees, two pieces of three-berry pie ...
NICKY
How much does that cost?
TREMAYNE
(taking it and passing it to Nicky)
I'm sure I don't know. And one super snow-frosted Twin
Peaks DoubleR chocolate malted.
ANDY
(to Nicky, engagingly)
Looks just like White Tail Mountain, doesn't it Nicky?
With a sudden burst from his little lungs, Nicky blows fiercely at the cream, causing it to fly
up into Andy's face. Tremayne laughs like a hyena. Andy fumbles for some napkins.
NICKY
Sorry, Uncle Andy.
Andy smiles. Uncle. Who could not love this kid?
TREMAYNE
Now you look like White Tail Mountain, Andrew.
Looks like you got a little on you too, Nicholas. We

TREMAYNE 
don't want to filthy up that stylish little shirt.

Tremayne reaches across Nicky to the napkin dispenser. Nicky begins rolling the base of his
malted along its circumference, like a tiring spun coin, then accidentally lets it drop forward,
spilling his malted all over the extended left arm of Tremayne's natty, expensive sport coat.
TREMAYNE 
Damn it! Damn it!
Nicky immediately begins to cry.
TREYMAYNE 
(recovering)
That's okay. It's fine, Nicky. It's completely all right.
Tremayne reaches over the counter for some more serious cleanup materials. Andy leans away
from the chocolate spreading over the counter to lunge for some napkins. Little Nicky, with
slightly unexpected strength gives Andy's stool a mighty spin. Still facing away from them
as he cleans himself off, Andy lowers himself back onto the edge of his seat, hits the spinning
stool and flies directly to the floor. Norma and Tremayne look up from their mopwork.
CLOSE ON Nicky, his cherubic face still streaked with whipped cream, the slight upward
curve of his lips suggesting a tiny, unsettling smile.
 EXT. EVELYN'S HOUSE

CUT TO:

Establish. An expansive house backing into a forest.
 INT. OPEN GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO:

James and Evelyn stand beside her husband's Dusenberg up on blocks.
EVELYN
I got a garage man to come out yesterday. Not that I
understood a single word he said. Something vague about
the front axle? He said he'll have to order it from God
knows where.
JAMES
(looking under the car)
Germany. Your garage man's playing it safe. I can put
this right. God, it's really beautiful.
She comes around closer, half-curious.
EVELYN
Jeffrey loves this car. My husband. Loves the car.




 




JAMES
Where is your husband, Mrs. Marsh?
EVELYN
I'm not sure this week. He travels extensively. Business.
(her palm flows along the hood)
The car was built in 1923. Jeffrey has to have the most
unique and beautiful toys. And they have to be perfect.
He's that way about everything he owns.
(beat)
I could have learned something from that; if I'd been
paying attention.
(he looks at her, feeling the undercurrent)
Are you that way, James? ... About your bike?
JAMES
Guess I'm not so interested in how my bike looks as I am
in where it can take me.
EVELYN
Where do you want to go?
JAMES
(grins)
It's not a place. It's a feeling.
(coming up from the car, looking out at the
road)
Sometimes riding at night, I punch off my headlight, turn
up the throttle and just go for it.
EVELYN
(smolders a little then)
So ... think you can fix it?
Sure.

JAMES

EVELYN
There's a room above the garage. You can stay there while
you work. If you like. Room and board. Whatever else
you think is fair. I really do need to have it done before
Jeffrey returns.
(beat, softly, not coy)
I'd like you to stay, James. I'd enjoy the company.
Okay.

JAMES

EVELYN
Good. It's settled then. I'll leave you to it.

James glances at her, feeling this fresh allure. She turns and starts away. James wonders a little
at her tone, and what he might be getting himself into.
CUT TO:
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
START CLOSE on a projector screen surrounded by darkness. Flickering before us is silent
footage of Ben as a young boy, eagerly witnessing a groundbreaking ceremony. Images of
young Ben, Jerry, their bearded FATHER, dance across the screen. Horne Sr. shoves a spade
into the ground, unearths the ceremonial soil. All clap and celebrate. Smiles abound. In a
background a large sign proclaims: FUTURE SITE OF THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL.
It's a sentimental journey back to a simpler time and place.
PULL BACK from the screen into the darkened office, shades drawn, to Ben, seated in the
screen's reflected light watching his old glory days, sipping from a crystal glass, a nearly
empty bourbon bottle beside him, cigar smoke snaking up through the projector's beam. Then,
quietly at first, eyes fixed upon the screen ... Ben recites:
BEN
"Now is the winter of our discontent/Made glorious
summer by this sun of York; And in all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house/In the deep bosom of the ocean
buried./Now are our brows bound with victorious
wreaths; Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our
stern alarums changed to merry meetings; Our dreadful
marches to delightful measures."
A door opens. The silhouette in the doorway causes Ben to immediately douse the projector
and turn on his desk lamp. On the desk are a box of kleenex and several silver gravity toys.
Hank enters.
HANK
A stag party. And I wasn't even invited.
BEN
Hank, where have you been?
HANK
Ben, I have had an absolutely killer schedule.
BEN
Do you know what kind of hell I've been through the last
few days? You said you took care of Catherine in the
mill fire: she's alive. And as you might imagine, not
happy about it. Through extortion and trickery, she's now
managed to cheat me out of both Ghostwood and the
mill. And then there's the small matter of my being
arrested for killing Laura Palmer, a real businessenhancer, on top of which my trusted solicitor, the late
Leland Palmer turns out to a homocidal lunatic!







 
Ben's eye is drawn to Laura's picture on his desk. He grows somber.
HANK
Tough week, Ben.
BEN
(a new obsession)
Do you think the furniture in this room is arranged
adequately? I've been toying with the notion that if one
could find the proper spatial relationship between all the
objects in a given space, it could create a resonance the
benefits of which to the individual dwelling in that space
could be extensive and far reaching. Help me move this
desk, would you?
Ben asks for a hand with the desk.
HANK
That's fascinating, Ben, really, listen, though, what we
have to do now is talk about One-Eyed Jacks.
BEN
Jacks, yes, One-Eyed Jacks, uh-huh.
HANK
Here's how it is, Ben. Ben, you're out.
BEN
Excuse me? I own One-Eyed Jack's.
HANK
There's been a friendly takeover.
BEN
You walk in here under my employ and have the gall HANK
Oh, that's another thing. I don't work for you anymore.
BEN
(controlling his rage)
Renault. Jean Renault. It's Renault, isn't it?
(no reply, but Ben knows)
Hank, that man is a psychopath. A psychopath! You're
dancing with the devil!
HANK
Ben, you're a nut.








 (2)
BEN
You think I'm going to sit here and take this lying down?
HANK
Ben. Life is change Listen to me when I tell you this is
how it's going to be BEN
Don't patronize me, you goon.
Hank steps forward and gives Ben a long look. A Hank special. The room's power shifts.
HANK
Look at you. You're a mess. You screwed up, boss man.
You're out, Ben.
Hank exits. Ben glares at the door, then glances over at the burbon bottle. The blank
projector screen, the hum of the projector. He pours himself a drink, slouches back in the chair,
bathed in the light of the projector. A beat. Ben manages a bizarre smile and makes shadow
puppets on the wall. Little dancing rabbits for his own amusement

 INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
Wedding preparations are in evidence. A bad ACCORDIAN PLAYER is warming up in
background. Cooper enters, makes his way to the front desk to collect his mail.

Cooper enters his hotel room, notices a larger envelope among the others. He opens it. Inside

COOPER

Windom Earle.
Cooper quickly takes out his recorder. He pops the tape in and hits play and listens with
growing horror ...







18A. 
WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
(think of Orson Welles)
Of course you couldn't help but take note of my
emphatically traditional opening. I must say your
responding move was nothing if not reflective of your
predeliction for the tidy and fastidious. See how my
response to you begins to lead us towards a classical
confrontation? But there's doubt in your mind: what are
my true intentions? How will you answer this time?
Hobgoblins, Dale; consistency, predictibility, giving rise
to patterns. We both know only too well how these
patterns leave you vulnerable to attack. You with your
wounds. I with mine. Let me paint you a picture. My
knights will skirmish. Lanes of power and influence will
open to my bishops and rooks. Pawns will naturally be
forfeit. I'm even prepared to sacrifice my queen because
I assure you, dear Dale, my goal will be attained at any
cost. The king must die.
The tape ends. Cooper grows pale.
FADE TO BLACK:
END ACT THREE


ACT FOUR




FADE IN:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Before the fireplace, the wedding ceremony of DOUGIE and LANA BUDDING is in
progress. Steady and easy, Dougie stands in a herringbone sports jacket and evergreen slacks.
Lana, her full body alight with flows of white and pink chiffon, looks something like an
exploding birthday cake.
The REVEREND performs the ceremony with a respectful air, seemingly dissembling his
own skepticism. The best man is PETE MARTELL; the maid of honor AUDREY HORNE.
Beyond them is a half-moon gallery seated in Great Northern dining chairs, with no separation
based on family (hers is not there). Some of those seated are Truman, Andy, Hawk, LOG
LADY, and a disgusted DWAYNE MILFORD, patting the hand of an older, blue-haired
WOMAN. Her stone-face suggests she is less than thrilled with the ongoing nuptials.
REVEREND
Do you, Douglas Milford, take this woman to be your
wife, to love and cherish, for as long as you both shall live.
DOUGIE
You bet, Reverend.
REVEREND
And do you, Lana Budding, take this man to be your
husband, to love honor and obey, so long as you both shall
live?
LANA
I do, your Honor.
REVEREND
If there be anyone here who knows not why this union
should be made, let him speak now or forever hold his DWAYNE
(leaping to his feet)
You're damned straight I object - that little
golddigger's after his money, his publishing empire, and
God knows what else - look at him, he's already got one
foot in the grave!
Truman and Hawk quickly hustle Dwayne off into the background.
TRUMAN
Okay, easy there, Mr. Mayor.



 




DWAYNE
(yelling as he exits)
Why isn't anybody from her family here? Any of you
asked yourselves that? Kind of peculiar, don't you think?

Pause. Dougie quietly comforts Lana.
DOUGIE
Don't give it another thought, doll.
REVEREND
So if there are no further objections ...
 INT. COOPER'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Cooper stands at his window, tape machine in hand.

CUT TO:

COOPER
Diane, I am standing at the window of my room at the
Great Northern, looking down at the wedding of Dougie
Milford and his youthful bride. The ceremony appears
quite simple; the groom, commencing his fifth marriage,
has apparently honed the procedure down to the bone.
The reception will be starting shortly and a good deal of
alcohol will undoubtedly be consumed in order to
accomodate our culturally prevelant rally discomfort with
mystery and ritual.
(turns from window, sets down recorder, begins
to dress, speaks while peering in mirror)
Diane, I anticipate your question. I am not down among
the revelers because my mind is burdened with questions:
what's become of Major Briggs? What is the true
significance of the White and Black Lodge? Has the
Major, clearly a man of no small spiritual advancement,
perhaps been attempting to make contact with some
element of these places in his top-secret work? Briggs is a
man of clear eye and deep thought; he sees right through
the illusory texture of this world and fluently reads
beneath it. You might meet a handful like him in a
lifetime. But if what Hawk has related to me about the
Black Lodge is true, even a man of Briggs' considerable
fortitude would be tested to his ultimate limits.
(sits down on the bed)
In an even darker corner of my thoughts is my old partner,
Windom Earle, the man who, prior to his utter mental
and emotional collapse, burned with a brilliance I doubt
I will ever see the equal of. Add to that the things I've
witnessed here at Twin Peaks: the tremendous evil forces
that linger on the periphery of this genuine, spirited little
town. The darkness Laura Palmer submitted to. The




 




COOPER 
vortex that swallowed and consumed Leland Palmer ...
Diane, as a human being learns and matures, one's
experiences grow proportionately more rich and
mysterious. Perhaps the questions I now seek answers to
lie beyond the old perameters. Beyond my life at the
bureau.

The phone rings. He clicks off. Picks up.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Cooper ... yes, Denise ... I'll be right down.
He hangs up, stands to put his coat on, clicks on the recorder one more time.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Diane, when I've got a bit more time, remind me to tell
you about Agent Bryson ...
DISSOLVE TO:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT
A mix of local townspeople and Dougie's friends. Cooper works his way through to find
Dennis/Denise waiting at the bar.
DENISE
Bad news first. I found cocaine residue in your car. My
guess is it's going to be a match to lot stolen from the
Mountie.
COOPER
Dennis, this can't look straight to you.
Denise.
Sorry.

DENISE
COOPER

DENISE
Sure it looks like a frame, Coop. But I'm going to need
more than your opinion to make that stick.
COOPER
Can you help me?
DENISE
(sips demurely)
That gets into a delicate area. But on the other hand I'm
trying very hard lately to be more in touch with my




 




DENISE 
feelings ...
(to the bartender)
Could I have another daquiri please?
COOPER
Dennis, if you don't mind my asking, what the hell
happened to you?
DENISE
Not at all. It's good to talk about it. It's simple,
really. Last year I was working undercover on a suburban
surveillance, some Bolivians were moving coke out of a
house across the street ... the seller had a few kinks, his rep
was he'd only sell to transvestites. So my partner and I
shacked up. I played the buyer and I found that wearing
women's clothes ... relaxed me. I continued wearing them
into the night. My partner thought it was my consummate
professionalism. It was a very confusing two weeks.
COOPER
To say the least.
DENISE
So one thing led to another and I'm currently into a
specialized kind of program called Gender Relocation
Inhibition Therapy, or G.R.I.T. Part of my treatment is
to dress the part for six months prior to any further
therapy; hormones, electrolysis COOPER
(more than he wanted to hear)
This is all a pretty astounding disclosure, Denise.
DENISE
Imagine how surprised I was. This isn't something you
exactly plan on.

A happy commotion from the reception across the room.
 PETE MARTELL AND DWAYNE MILFORD

CUT TO:

Seated a small table along the way, Pete and Dwayne sit over a couple drinks, watching
Dougie cuddle with his bride over the cutting of the wedding cake.
DWAYNE
She started by taking one of Dougie's college classes.
Ethics in Modern Journalism. Two things I guarantee you
that little bird knows nothing about. Three weeks later




 




DWAYNE 
she's landed a job writing for the Gazette. Dougie's
always been a sucker. A woman walks by with play in her
eyes and jello in her walk, and he's a trout on a hook.
PETE
We all kinda' live in that glass house, don't you think,
Dwayne?
DWAYNE
I was married to the same woman for half a century, god
rest her soul. That's because I think with my brain, not
my garden hose PETE
(trying to be positive)
Music turned out pretty good.
DWAYNE
Oughta' be a death march.
Across the room, Lana holds the ceremonial bouquet before a host of eager women. She flings
it up into a looping flight, from where it's suddenly snatched by an agile Denise. There's some
surly mumbling amongst the other girls about the bouquet-snagging by this ringer. Denise
sashays back to the bar, where Truman has now joined Cooper.
DENISE
Unfair advantage. How many of those girls were Varsity
wide receivers?
TRUMAN
Hope those two go up to the honeymoon suite soon. We've
had to separate Dwayne and Dougie twice. Happens
every wedding. My theory is Dwayne's jealous.
The ensemble music kicks up again. Denise looks a little wistful. Lana and Dougie swing by
in greeting.
DOUGIE
Sheriff, arrest this woman. She's too beautiful to be
living in this state.
LANA
Dougie, you say the sweetest things...
(a glance at Cooper)
Aren't you the FBI man?
COOPER
Not currently, no.

Truman and Bryson's respectful silence.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Dale Cooper.
LANA
You solved the Laura Palmer case.
DOUGIE
Come on, my darling, they're playing our tune.
They move off. Coming up on the periphery of this circle is Audrey Horne, approaching
Cooper, who pivots slightly on his barstool, folding them into a semi-private exchange.
AUDREY
Excuse me. Didn't you ... rescue me once?
COOPER
That's one version of the story.
AUDREY
One last dance?
Cooper accompanies her off to the dance floor. Denise sways slightly. It is now just he and
Truman. And Andy, hovering nearby.
DENISE
I love this music.
(waits for a response)
God ... I feel a little awkward. I .. would you ...
Truman's eyes widen with understanding. It's a waltz. Not that it really matters what it is.
TRUMAN
I'm not ... much of a dancer.
An awkward pause.

ANDY
(gallantly inserting himself)
May I have this dance?
Thank you.

DENISE

Denise takes Andy's arm, as they move over toward the floor.
TRUMAN
(to himself)
He's a nice guy but everybody's got their limits.

CUT TO:


 DANCE FLOOR




Pete and Lana dancing, with a surprising compatibility.
PETE
You dance like a scream.
LANA
Thanks. You move very smoothly, too.
Thanks.

PETE

Lana looks at him with bubbly respect. MOVE OFF to Cooper dancing with Audrey.
AUDREY
I heard you might be in trouble.
COOPER
Trouble in this instance, Audrey, may be a door to a new
way of looking at the world.
AUDREY
I guess you could say that about everything you do.
COOPER
That's my hope, Audrey and my aspiration.
AUDREY
Well, if you ever decide to come down off the mountain
top and mingle with us regular folks, I'd like to hear
some of your stories.
COOPER
It's a deal. I hope they're interesting ones.
She smiles. He returns it. MOVE OFF them to Andy and Denise; Denise is an excellent
dancer. And, surprise ... so is Andy. HOLD ON them for a beat. Something absurd and sweet
in Harry's gentlemanly acceptance. Couples now swirl about CAMERA, in a celebratory
rhythm ...
 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSE ON a framed photograph on the table: it is a closeup of Andrew Packard. SHOT
OPENS to show Josie Packard enter this living room and take a seat. CATHERINE
MARTELL sits assuredly across from her behind the desk.
JOSIE
Thank you for seeing me.



 




Catherine says nothing; her eyes give a quick glimmer of amusement.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
Believe it or not, I came here to help you.
(Catherine's exhale of disbelief)
I won't waste your time. Your brother, my husband,
Andrew Packard ...
(a respectful glance over at the photograph)
... was killed by a man named Thomas Eckhardt.
Catherine's face retains its emotionless appearance.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
Eight years ago, Andrew got the better of Eckhardt in a
business deal. Eckhardt never forgets a slight. He sets an
hour aside every day to think about how he will ruin his
enemies. In this case, I was his answer. He introduced
me to Andrew. I was to make Andrew fall in love with
me, marry him and eventually help Eckhardt kill him.
Josie pauses, awaiting Catherine's response. She looks back in quiet arrogance.
CATHERINE
Dear, your slip is showing.
Excuse me?

JOSIE

CATHERINE
(being clearer)
Tell me something I don't already know.
A beat. Josie hides her dismay.
JOSIE
Eckhardt is the most evil man I've ever known. His
design was to ruin the Packard family, not just Andrew.
I've escaped him for the moment, but he'll come back for
me. And for you. That is why I'm here.
CATHERINE
How endearing.
JOSIE
Catherine, you're in terrible danger.
CATHERINE
You help kill my brother, try to cheat me out of my land,
my family's lifeblood, utterly destroy my existence and
now you want to save me.



 (2)




JOSIE
I had to do those things to stay alive. There is no one else
I can turn to. My insurance payment has been held up
pending an arson investigation. Ben gave me a five
million dollar check that is utterly worthless.
CATHERINE
(she knows all about it)
How unfortunate ...
JOSIE
(her final plea)
I have no money. I am at your mercy.

Having tired of this entertainment, Catherine moves a pawn forward.
CATHERINE
Enough. Save your tears. Be practical: what do you
propose we do?
JOSIE
I don't know ...
Catherine's thoughtful moment. Josie watches her.
CATHERINE
Then I'll tell you. From now on, you work for me. Here
at the house. As a maid. You'll move your things to the
servant's quarters. If you disobey me, if you lie to me, if
you contradict a single thing I tell you, I'll find this
Eckhardt myself and feed you to him by hand. Is that
clear?
Josie is shocked. Chastened.
Speak.

CATHERINE 

JOSIE
Yes I understand.
CATHERINE
Fine. We'll talk about this Eckhardt and what we plan to
do another time. You may go to your room.
JOSIE
Yes. Thank you.
CATHERINE
I'll take breakfast at seven in my room. Coffee, juice,

house. Someone entering this room.
SHOT OPENS to reveal a MAN standing beside the table. It is the man in the photograph.
ANDREW PACKARD.
CATHERINE
(with a satisfied smirk)
Happy, Andrew?
ANDREW
(with a nod)
Everything is going exactly as we planned.
CATHERINE
And now ... ?
ANDREW
And now, dear sister. We wait for Thomas Eckhardt to
come looking for his one true love. And when he does ...
CATHERINE
(conspiratorial)
... We'll be waiting for him.
HOLD ON Packard for a beat. His confident assent.

BOBBY BRIGGS, pumped for action, marches in the door wearing Leo's suit. BEN HORNE
with his back to Bobby doesn't seem to know he's there, is pushing furniture around the room.
BOBBY
Mr. Horne? ... Mr. Horne?
Bobby studies the furniture arrangement; most of it is stacked up against one wall. He looks at
Horne; unshaven and in a bathrobe. Ben spins around to stare at him.
BOBBY
Your secretary said to come in. Bobby Briggs.
BEN
Do you know what you have to have in this life, Bobby?
Balance. Distance. Symmetry. Look.

Isn't that a beautiful thing?
BOBBY
Mr. Horne. Did you listen to the tape?
BEN
I listened to your tape Bobby. Frankly, I'm surprised
that Leo could master the technology, but ...

Damn it, talk to me, Bobby.
BOBBY
Mr. Horne, I have a great admiration for you.
BEN
Admiration is for poets and dairy cows.
BOBBY

Sir, you called and asked to see me.

You're standing in front of a mammoth skyscraper. A
leviathan that rips the clouds open. What's the first

Pardon?

BEN
The first thing you ask is "What's on the top floor?"
"Who's up in that penthouse, and why?" That's what I'm
like. Are you?.
BOBBY

Of course I am.
BEN

Opportunity knocks, Bobby. Follow Hank Jennings.
Chronicle his existence. Show me something I don't
already know.
BOBBY
Uh ... how much do I get for this.
BEN
What are you making now?
BOBBY
I'm in high school.
Ben takes out a roll of bills, peels off a single bill and hands it to Bobby.
BEN
Congratulations. A 100% raise.

Bobby exits into the corridor. He is stopped by a SCREAM behind him that starts far away
and moves towards him. A drop dead blonde, LANA BUDDING MILFORD, draped in her
bridal nightgown, rushes by him. Bobby smiles helplessly slowly closing the door on the strap of
the camera case. The Bride resumes her scream going around the corner. Bobby starts to
follow only to be yanked back by the strap caught in the door.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
COOPER and a realtor, IRENE LITTLEHORSE, an American Indian in her mid-fifties,
look at a book with photographs of her listings.
LITTLEHORSE
Mr. Cooper, are you looking to rent or would you
consider leasing with an option to buy?
COOPER
I'm looking for a little piece of paradise. Upon finding
it, I'll consider any option.









LITTLEHORSE
This just came on the market; it's a Victorian, 1890's. I
can also recommend the old Longacre house.
COOPER
I'd like to see them both.
LITTLEHORSE
Very good. Which would you like to see first?
Cooper smiles. Takes a coin from his pocket. Flips it onto the table. It rolls and stops on a
picture of yet another property.
What is this?

COOPER

LITTLEHORSE
I thought I'd take that out. This property is called
"Dead Dog Farm." And it's worse than it sounds.
COOPER
(intuitive interest)
"Dead Dog Farm." What is it?
LITTLEHORSE
A puzzle. No one ever stays there long Dreamer after
dreamer has worked that patch of land.
COOPER
"A parcel of vain strivings tied by a chance bond
together."
Littlehorse smiles at Cooper.
LITTLEHORSE
I read Thoreau myself, Mr. Cooper. I have to warn you,
this isn't exactly Walden Pond.
COOPER
When can I see it?


INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

COLONEL CALVIN REILLY, black, sixty, made of brick sits across from Truman.
REILLY
Sheriff, what do you know about Major Briggs work?






TRUMAN
Well, I guess all I know is he's doing something top
secret.
Cooper sticks his head in the door.
Harry?

COOPER

TRUMAN
Cooper, this is Colonel Reilly. He's heading up the Air
Force's investigation into Briggs' disappearance.
REILLY
Cooper. Just about to hunt you down. You were with
Briggs when we lost his coordinates.
Correct.

COOPER

Reilly drops a map on Truman's desk. Points to a circled location.
REILLY
The area where he disappeared. Now when you were at
the site, did you happen to see any wildlife in the area?
Wildlife?

COOPER

REILLY
Squirrels, skunks, ground hogs.
No ...

COOPER

REILLY
Any birds? ... Owls.
COOPER
Moments before the Major disappeared I heard an owl.
REILLY
(not giving away a thing)
No visual contact?
TRUMAN
Look, Colonel, Garland Briggs is a good friend of mine
and this has us more than a little spooked. I really wish
you'd just level with us.









(2)
REILLY
Can you clarify that?
COOPER
(a look at Truman)
We know about your monitors and the messages you
received from deep space that pertain to me.
REILLY
You may know something but you'd best get your facts
straight: our "monitors" are pointed at deep space, but
the messages we intercepted that Briggs showed you
were sent from right here in these woods. Where they
were being sent to is another question.
He points to the map again, near the disappearance site. A stunned moment as this sinks in.
COOPER
Colonel, does this have anything to do with a place
called the White Lodge?
REILLY
(taken aback)
That's classified.
TRUMAN
(pause, a look at Cooper)
Look, Colonel, we'd like to help you but you're not
making it any easier.
REILLY
(pause)
Garland Briggs is the best pilot I've ever known. He was
born with hardware most of us only dream of having.
He's been walking point on this operation for three years,
carrying a full pack. I'll tell you this: his disappearance
has implications that go so far beyond national security
the cold war seems like a case of the sniffles.



INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY

CUT TO:

ANDY BRENNAN, LUCY and JUDY SWAIN, from the HAPPY HELPING HAND
organization chat on the sofa near the reception area. SWAIN references large file folders in
front of her.










RICHARD TREMAYNE hurries in to join them.
TREMAYNE
Sorry I'm late, but the little Nipper is so excited about
our camping trip I couldn't coax him out of the car.
ANDY
Richard, this is Judy Swain from the Happy Helping
Hand organization
SWAIN
I'm Little Nicky's case manager.
TREMAYNE
Charmed, I'm sure.









(2)
SWAIN
As I was about to tell your friends, the number one thing
to know about Nicky is that throughout his brief life he
has been confused, and perhaps traumatized, by a
persistent random misfortune.
TREYMAYNE
(noticing the size of Nicky's files)
Looks like he's bounced around quite a bit.
LUCY
The poor child.
SWAIN
Yes. An orphan, you know.
ANDY
Really? What happened? Did his parents die?
TREMAYNE
Nicely deduced, Andrew. Persistent random
misfortune.
SWAIN
They were killed.
TREMYANE
(a look at Andy)
How were they killed, Miss Swain?
SWAIN
Mysterious circumstances. I'm afraid the orphanage has
never provided us with that information.
Sheriff Truman hustles out of his office to announce ...
TRUMAN
Andy, let's go. We've got an emergency at the Great
Northern.



INT. MARSH HOUSE, JAMES' ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

JAMES sits on his bed cleaning some of his tools. He is interrupted by MALCOLM, Evelyn
Marsh's brother, carrying a large cocktail. Uniformed. Thirties. Tipsy. Oddly vulnerable.










JAMES
Can I help you?
MALCOLM
I'm heading up the local serf rebellion. Wondering if
you'd help me bundle up loose sticks to burn the master.
Malcolm. Malcom Sloan.
(shaking his hand)
As in "Brother to Evelyn." I'm Mr. Marsh's driver ... as
in "Bring the car around, James."
(takes a belt from his drink)
I spend a lot of time waiting at airports, happily
basking in the glow of cocktail lounge flourescents.
(sits across from James)
How badly did she damage the Jag?
JAMES
It's repairable.
MALCOLM
That's the nice thing about things. When she and Jeffrey
fell In love, he gave her a new life. I got a nice uniform
and the keys to the liquor cabinet.
(another drink)
Hope I don't sound ungrateful. Compared to the life I
was living wanton dissipation is a step up - and Evelyn,
well, she's learned a lot herself. Defensive postures.
Masking bruises. Vicious cycles.
JAMES
What are you talking about?
MALCOLM
I'm sorry, am I being obscure? Once a fortnight, Jeffrey
pounds her mercilessly and she tries to get even by
breaking one of his things, which perpetuates the cycle.
JAMES
She's your sister, why don't you stop him?
MALCOLM
Sonny boy, nobody stops Mr. Marsh. That's the golden
rule around here. Jot it down and put it under your
pillow.
(finishes his drink, almost tears)
No one can do anything.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
The corpse of DOUGIE MILFORD lies in the bed. A frozen grin is plastered on his face as
DOC HAYWARD finishes a cursory exam and pulls a sheet over his head.
DOC
Looks like a heart attack.
Andy and Truman stand by. Dougie's dead hand clasping an open book falls out from below
the sheet. Andy leans over and reads.
ANDY
"Once stimulated the female will respond in such a way
that the skin around the ..." oh my God ...
TRUMAN
Guess Dougie went out with his boots on.
DOC
(gently takes the book from Andy)
"My Secret Life."
TRUMAN
I'll say ...
(inspects other books on the nightstand)
"Kama Sutra," "Collected Poems of Byron," "Hookers
and Handmaidens."
Andy discovers an ornate, purple wooden BOX on a luggage stand.
ANDY
Sheriff? Look at this.
The three gather around it and slowly, silently take out it's contents: two red clown noses,
monk's robe and cowl, large rubber bands, lotions, an eggbeater, and, finally, a lifelike mask
that bears an eerie resemblance to Gary Crosby. They stand there in awe of this discovery
until their focus is broken by shouting at the door. Mayor DWAYNE MILFORD, Dougie's
brother, walks into the room swelling with emotion.
DWAYNE
What a falling off was here ... Dougie. Lord, I hate to
say I told you so.
(sees and grabs the copy of Kama Sutra)
Here it is, Sheriff. The murder weapon. She might as
well have blown his brains out with a rifle. He never
could say no to a woman ... the old fool.
He begins to weep. Truman gestures to Andy who gently leads the Mayor to the door. Andy
opens the door and hands the mayor over to two DEPUTIES standing outside.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE ROOM - DAY
As the deputies take Dwayne out he spots Lana, giving her statement to Hawk.
DWAYNE
You sexual Howitzer. You'll burn in hell for this.
HAWK
Take it easy, Mr. Milford DWAYNE
I'm going to shout to wake the dead! She murdered my
brother, she's a witch!
He makes a pathetic attempt to get to her, forcing the deputies to lead him away. Lana begins
to weep. Hawk tries to comfort her.
LANA
He's right. I'm cursed.
HAWK
Don't be silly.
LANA
No, it's true. It started in high school. Prom night.
My date went to kiss me ... it was his first day with
braces. They gleamed in the moonlight ... and his jaw
locked open.
(barely holding on)
We ended up in the emergency room. The doctors had
to break his jaw in three places to get it to shut. It's
gotten worse ever since.
HAWK
(taking a chair beside her)
A curse needs a cure. I know a bit about these things.
BRIDE
Are you the sheriff?
Hawk idly leans his chair back against the door to Dougie's room. Puffing up.
HAWK
Let's just say that when something big goes down, I just
happen to be the man who's Andy opens the door behind him. Hawk goes over. On his back he looks up to see Andy
beaming stupidly at the bride, caught in her spell, as he steps on Hawk's hand.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
Wrestling coach, BUCK WINGATE, lectures his assembled squad who stare at NADINE
HURLEY and MIKE NELSON standing next to one another in wrestling gear on the mat.
WINGATE
Boys, there's a story about a great football coach whose
name escapes me at the time who was dead set against
having black players on his team until the day they
brought him the most fantastic black halfback anyone
had ever seen. When what's his name watched him run
fifty yards and no one laid a hand on him, he shouted,
"Look at that Indian go!"
(slaps an arm around Nadine)
That coach accepted that athlete's desire to compete.
Today that same story applies to this woman's ... young
girl's right to compete as well. In addition to which,
it's her moral and constitutional right.
(now puts his arm around Mike)
Nadine has asked to prove herself to us by wrestling the
very best: our very own District champion, Mike Nelson
(he turns Nadine and Mike toward each other)
Ready to wrestle at the sound of the whistle ...
Wingate blows his whistle. Nadine and Mike circle each other looking for the take down.
Hesitatingly, Mike makes a move for Nadine's legs, she takes him by the shoulders and lifts
him above her head. She carries on a conversation only she and Mike can hear.
Hi, Mike.

NADINE

MIKE
What are you doing?
Mike looks down at Nadine helplessly. She lowers him to the mat. Whispering to him.
NADINE
Isn't it fun we get to be so close in public?
MIKE
(struggling for air)
Neck ... you're breaking my NADINE
You're right. This is almost like necking.
With great effort Mike escapes, but after her quick move he is in Nadine's bear hug.










NADINE 
(sing song)
I can smell your aftershave.
(brings him down again, his face into the matt)
Want to go do something tonight? I don't have a curfew
... hint, hint.
The rest of the team is yelling: "Pin ... Pin ..." Mike lets out a groan. To Nadine it is an
answer she can't hear. She flips him over to his back.
NADINE
What'd you say Mike?
MIKE
(fearing for his life)
Yes. Yes.
He's pinned. Coach Wingate holds up Nadine's arm.
WINGATE
Welcome aboard, Nadine Too bad you're a senior.
Nadine beams at Mike who returns her look with terror.

 EXT. DEAD DOG

Cooper and Littlehorse stare at the house on Dead Dog Farms. An abandoned building on a
derelict farm. FADED SHUTTERS guard the window.
LITTLEHORSE
Still standing almost by force of habit.
COOPER
Habit can provide a strong foundation. Why is it called
Dead Dog Farm?
LITTLEHORSE
An old legend. Of all the people in the world the worst
and the best are drawn to a dead dog.
(off Cooper curious look)
Most turn away; those with the purest of hearts feel its
pain. Somewhere in between the rest of us struggle.
Cooper nods, walks up the muddy driveway. He stops when he sees TIRE TRACKS.
COOPER
Have you showed the property to anyone else recently?





 



LITTLEHORSE
I don't think anyone's asked to see it this last year.

Cooper walks in the tracks; first one, then another, and another. Almost walking in circles.
COOPER
Three cars. One a jeep, one a four-wheeler. Third's a
domestic sedan ... boot prints.
Cooper follows them towards the door. Irene follows.
 INT. KITCHEN, DEAD DOG FARM HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO:

Littlehorse follows Cooper into the room. The place is a mess with the exception of a table
and chairs set upright. Cooper sits in a chair and then sits in one opposite it, studies the angles.
Examines some ashes on the floor.
LITTLEHORSE
What are you seeing?
COOPER
There's been a meeting here. Within the last few hours.
He hunts around for something else. Sticks his hand into the drain in the sink.
COOPER
They forgot there was no running water.
(brings out a bit of fine white powder; holds it
to the realtor's nose)
Smell anything?
No.

LITTLEHORSE

COOPER
Baby laxative.
Cooper lies on the floor under the table with his head flat against it. A bird's eye view. He
slides his head along the floor. Finds what he is looking for. He licks his finger, runs it along
the floor and brings it up covered with white powder. He shows it to Littlehorse.
LITTLEHORSE
More white powder.
Cooper holds the hand with the powder from the drain in the sink up to Littlehorse.
COOPER
(shows his white finger)
Cocaine. Irene, we have to notify the sheriff.

CUT TO:





 EXT. ROAD IN THE WOODS - DAY
Tremayne's car is pulled to the side of the road with a flat tire. Tremayne has managed to get
the car up on a jack. The lug nuts, the spare wheel, and the flat tire lie before him. He's trying
to read the jack's directions, leaning against the hood.
TREMAYNE
I don't understand this at all. I just had the car checked
at the Gas Farm and they assured me everything was in
perfect working order. This all seems so ... technical.
(his concentration is broken by a piercing blast
from the car's horn)
Please, Nicky, Uncle Dick is trying to read (drowned out by more blasts from the horn.
Tremayne snaps)
Get out of the car, Nicholas. Nicholas, get out of the
car! Right now, out of the car! Out of the CAR!
The horn stops. Pause. Nicky exits the car and moves sheepishly to Tremayne.
NICKY
Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?
TREMAYNE
(back in control)
No, no, of course, not. Why should I be mad?
NICKY
I scared you, didn't I? You jumped around like a do- do
bird.
He laughs. Tremayne goes back to work. Nicky wanders away.
ANOTHER ANGLE

QUICK DISSOLVE:

Tremayne brings the tire up to put it on the axle, he leans into the wheel well. As he does this
the car slowly begins to rock off it's jack ... about to come down on Tremayne's neck and
shoulder. Tremayne realizes this just in time and pulls away. His glove is caught in the wheel
well. He watches as the fingers of the glove are torn off and crushed. A very close call. From
behind him, Nicky appears crying his eyes out.
NICKY
Uncle Dick, Uncle Dick.
He rushes into Tremayne's embrace.
TREMAYNE
I'm alright. Don't worry.
(Nicky wails)
What? What is it, Little Nicky?







 
NICKY
What if you died? You're aren't going to die, are you?
TREMAYNE
Of course not, Nicky. Don't be silly.
As he comforts Nicky, Tremayne studies the overturned jack and the car sitting on absolutely
flat land. His smile fades.
 INT. EVELYN'S GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO:

James works below the Dusenberg on a sled. EVELYN MARSH moves into the room. James
sneaks a look as she walks towards the car; she wears an opened blouse and cut off jeans. She
carries a six pack of beer and limes. James slides the sled out.
Coffe break?

EVELYN

JAMES
Sounds great. Give me just a second.
James slides back under for a moment. Evelyn drifts to the window, stands in the sunlight.
EVELYN
It's so hot today. Feels like Indian summer. Can you
have Indian summer in the spring?
JAMES
I don't know why not.
She turns back, as James comes out from under the car.
EVELYN
I love the sun. Feels like it could just burn away all your
troubles. Wouldn't that be nice?
JAMES
(takes a pull on the beer)
I guess.
EVELYN
You've got troubles, don't you? Maybe someday we
should tell each other all our sad stories.
JAMES
That could take a while.



 
EVELYN
(pause)
You must be absolutely fried working under there.
JAMES
Not so bad. Here, look.
He enthusiastically slides behind the wheel of the car. Turns the key and the car's engine
ignites and purrs.
JAMES
Engine's fine. Think the axle'll be okay, too.
EVELYN
How'd you get so good at this?
JAMES
My Uncle Ed. You think I'm good you should see him.
He can fix anything.
Anything?

EVELYN

Evelyn is lost in a sad thought. James snuggles with her gloom.
JAMES
Met your brother today. We were talking. About your
situation and everything EVELYN
Mind your own business, James.
JAMES
A guy like me, I look at you, you've got this house, all
these things, you're young and beautiful, maybe I'm
dumb but I don't get it. Why are you so sad?
EVELYN
(a naked look at him)
Am I so easy to read?
JAMES
You afraid of something? Afraid of your husband?
(she looks away)
Are you?
EVELYN
Do you know what it's like ... to be so alone and so
scared that all you can think about is the wrong thing?








 (2)
JAMES
I know what it's like to be alone.
EVELYN
James. James. You're so sweet.
He wipes the tears off her cheek. They stare at each other for a moment. Then slowly they kiss.
EVELYN 
... I feel like he's stealing my life away.
JAMES
Why don't you leave?
EVELYN
It's ... complicated.
Evelyn clings to James. They kiss again. The tender kiss melts into passion. Only to be
interrupted by the a CAR HORN.
EVELYN
My God, it's him.
A car pulls up into the courtyard. She pulls away from him.
EVELYN 
I've got to go. Don't worry about it. It's not as bad as
all that. Please don't worry about me. Promise.
JEFFREY'S VOICE
(cheerful shout)
Evelyn, where are you, dear?
Evelyn kisses him again, lightly, then hurries to the door. James goes to the window. He
listens and watches Evelyn greet her husband.
INTERCUT:

 JAMES POV

A limo's parked outside. Thru the window he sees Evelyn embrace JEFFREY MARSH, a
large, middle-aged man. James can't quite see his face. Walking in front of Jeffrey, carrying
bags to the house is Malcolm. He faintly hears their voices.
EVELYN
How was your trip?
JEFFREY
Fine. Fine, dear. I brought you something.

They move into the house. James watches, hurting for Evelyn, hating Jeffrey.

I got beat up ... by a girl.
DONNA

MIKE
I don't want to go out with anyone who can pin me.
DONNA
Well what do you want me to do about it?



 



MIKE
You could talk to her or something. Pretend you're still

Bobby turns and walks away. Audrey watches him exit into the office. Then she goes into her

looks at it, puzzled. Ben steps into the room , unshaven, wearing a grey civil war tunic, carrying
a large Confederate flag. Bobby leaps to his feet, brimming with newfound confidence.
BOBBY
Hey, Ben, how's it going?
BEN
(deadpan, reacting to the use of his given name)
Why is God punishing me?
BOBBY

I followed Hank. Got the pictures. Just like you

BEN
Gettysburg. Day One. The South is winning.
Ben takes the envelope, crosses to his desk, slumps down into the chair. Bobby sits on a desk








 
corner, oblivious to Ben's glare.

BOBBY
I don't know what Hank's up to, but I figure it's no good.
He's meeting guys I've never seen before, and these boys
ain't exactly from the Rotary, if you know what I mean.
Ben holds up a hand to stop his babbling. Bobby stops immediately. Ben peers long and hard

We haven't actually discussed Ben reaches into his wallet, extracts a new bill. Hands it to Bobby.

PETE
The trick is to twist and pull the cork at the same time ...
CATHERINE'S VOICE
The trick is to open the damn bottle before the vintage
expires.
Pete and CATHERINE MARTELL in the Blue Pine dining room. A celebratory meal
before them. Pete wrestles with the cork, finally POPS it. The cork ricochets off the ceiling.







 
Champagne bubbles forth, spilling upon the table. Catherine holds out her goblet.
PETE
Nectar of the Gods, Catherine. It's the bubbles.
Pete manages to move some of the froth inside her glass, then his own. Pete smiles, holds his
glass into the air. He means to propose a roast. Catherine grudgingly follows suit.
PETE
"Wine comes in at the mouth, love comes in at the eye; I
hold my glass to my lips, I look at you and sigh ..."

Thank you, Catherine. I will try to do the same.
CATHERINE
We'll have our appetizers now.
(Josie starts to leave)
And put on your little maid's cap.
JOSIE
Yes, Catherine.

Josie goes to the kitchen. Catherine finishes her champagne, pours herself a second glass. Pete
watches Josie exit, then, quietly:
PETE
Catherine? You think maybe you're being a little hard on
her? I mean she's still part of the family and all.
CATHERINE
Peter, for your information, Josie had a hand in
Andrew's death and did everything in her power to
destroy me. She's lucky she's not swinging from a tree.
PETE
I don't believe it. Not the Josie I know ...
CATHERINE
(almost affectionate)
Oh, Pete. If gullibility was an aphrodisiac, you'd be a
Harem King.
Pete takes the latter as a compliment. Or maybe he's being sarcastic. It's hard to tell.
PETE
You're too kind.
Exasperated, Catherine finishes her second glass. Pours a third. She looks at Pete, considers
their life together. And raises her own hand into the air, getting a little tipsy.
CATHERINE
I'd like to propose a toast.
Pete hefts a glass of milk.
CATHERINE
(to her somewhat hollow victory)
Here's to Ben Horne's doublecross; here's to Josie
Packard's dirty deeds; and here's to the woman who

COOPER
Diane, I am holding in my hand a nationally distributed
newspaper. Plenty of color pictures. My opening move
responding to Earle's opening move was printed per my
instructions in the Personals column ... but I've already
received his response to this ... yesterday. He
anticipated my opening move perfectly. I wonder where
he is. I wonder what he's planning.

In the meantime, I have spent my first full day without
badge and gun the best way I know how: occupying both
body and spirit. Real estate, Diane what the local agent
charitably describes as a Fixer-Upper. Nonetheless, it's

both someday. However, as is so often the case, even this
bucolic hideway is filled with secrets. Secrets that
may be connected to my troubles with the Bureau. Not
to mention the cocaine found in my automobile.
(beat, a little sad)
Agent Hardy's deliberations will soon be completed. If
I can't adequately defend myself there is the very real
possibility of imprisonment. Other innocent men have
served there, apparently with no great detriment to the
development of their character. If I must go, I hope I
can uphold the tradition established by Doestoyevsky,
Solzhinytsen and many other great Russian authors.
Cooper pauses, sad, uncertain. He pulls the Bookhouse Boy patch out of his pocket, just holds
it for a moment. As if to consider his future. Suddenly: a knock at the door. Cooper turns off
the recorder, steps carefully to answer it. Out of habit, he reaches toward his shoulder holster,
reacts. He has no gun to protect himself. A beat. More knocking. Cooper answers and reveals
Audrey Horne holding the manila envelope last seen in her father's office.



 
Audrey.



COOPER

AUDREY
Hello, Agent Cooper.
(holding envelope to him)
This is for you. I stole it.
COOPER
(gently)
Then I suggest you give it back.
AUDREY
Not until you look inside.
COOPER
What will I find there?
AUDREY
Pictures my father paid for.
A beat. Cooper takes the envelope, steps from the door. Audrey follows. Cooper removes the
photographs, produces a magnifying glass. And examines them: black and white snaps taken
at Dead Dog Farm. The weatherbeaten house, its distinctive shutters, visible in the
background. But, more importantly: Hank Jennings meeting with several men: Ernie Niles,
Jean Renault and the Mountie, Preston King.
AUDREY
I did good, didn't I?
COOPER
(looking up from pictures)
You did better than good. You may have saved my life.
AUDREY
Good. So now we're even.
Another knock at the door.
Excuse me.

COOPER

Cooper steps to the door, opens it a second time.
Denise.

COOPER

DENISE BRYSON steps into the room. Audrey reacts, disappointment turns to jealousy.



 (2)

AUDREY
Sorry. I didn't know I was interrupting COOPER
Business, Audrey. This is Agent Denise Bryson, Drug
Enforcement Agency. Denise, I'd like you to meet a
very good friend of mine. Audrey Horne.
AUDREY
(extending a hand)
They have girl agents?
DENISE
(shaking it)
More or less.
COOPER
Audrey, would you excuse, us please? Agency business.
AUDREY
I thought you were grounded.
COOPER
Not for long. Goodnight. Thank you again.
AUDREY
Goodnight. You're welcome.

Audrey pauses. Then, quite suddenly, she raises up and kisses Cooper on the mouth. Audrey
takes a proud look at Denise, and steps out the door. A beat. Both ignoring the stolen kiss.
Cooper hands the photographs to Denise.
COOPER
I spent the late morning looking at an abandoned
property on the outskirts of town. Tire tracks indicated
recent activity. In the kitchen, I found traces of cocaine
and the baby laxitive used to step it out. These pictures
place Jean Renault, Hank Jennings, Norma Jennings'
father-in-law, and Preston King, Mountie, at the same
scene earlier today.
DENISE
(looking at photos, dryly)
I wonder who brought the coffee cake.
Cooper reaches into his bag, reveals the envelope of cocaine he took from the farm.
COOPER
Check this sample I took from the farmhouse with the

COOPER 
cocaine found in my automobile and I think you'll find
it's a match. I was set up and I can prove it.
Denise takes the envelope.
DENISE
Let's talk about something more important: exactly how
old is that girl?
COOPER
I would have assumed you were no longer interested in
women.
DENISE
Hey, I may be wearing a dress but I still put my panties
on one leg at a time, if you know what I mean.
COOPER
(a smile)
I know exactly what you mean.

 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
Richard Tremayne enters. Lucy reacts, Tremayne smiles, doesn't even stop to offer an unctious
hello. Instead, he calls out to Andy as he passes.
Andrew!

TREMAYNE

ANDY
What is it, Dick?




 




TREMAYNE
May I have a word with you?
Sure.

ANDY

Lucy frowns as the two men seek privacy in a corner. Tremayne looks left and right, quietly:
TREMAYNE
Andy, I fear we may have a problem.
ANDY
What problem?
TREMAYNE
It's our mutual friend, Little Nicky.
Yes?

ANDY

TREMAYNE
How shall I put this, you see, the child is, well he's ...
(deep breath, to the point)
Andy, I believe that Little Nicky, incredible as it may
seem ... may in fact be the Devil.
The devil?

ANDY

TREMAYNE
Or at the very least homicidal in the first degree. Andy,
we've got to find out what happened to Nicky's parents.
Doc Hayward moves past them to enter Truman's office.
 INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Doc Hayward enters. Dwayne Milford and Truman are seated.
HAYWARD
I've got the autopsy results. Dwayne, Dougie died of
natural causes. Heart attack. No evidence of foul play.
DWAYNE
Did you check him for witchcraft?
HAYWARD
That's not the kind of thing that would show up in an










 
autopsy.

HAYWARD 

DWAYNE
(to Truman)
I want to press charges.
TRUMAN
Dwayne, I can't press charges if there hasn't been a crime.
DWAYNE
She killed him with sex! How much clearer does it have
to be?
TRUMAN
Dwayne, it's been a long, hard day. Why don't you go
home and get some rest DWAYNE
Rest?! You expect me to sleep?! Not until that
murderous hussy is behind bars where she belongs. I'll
sue, I'll bring civil suits, she'll never get her hands on
Dougie's money, not as long as I draw breath, NOT
ONE RED CENT!!
And with that, Dwayne storms out, Truman and Hayward follow him out into reception ...
joining Tremayne and Deputy Andy, as they watch Dwayne's outbreak. A beat. Someone clears
their throat behind them. All turn to find Hawk standing in the doorway of the conference
room, Lana Budding at his side.
HAWK
Harry do you still have that bottle of Irish in your
office? I thought I might add a little to some warm
milk for the Widow Mildord.
Lana sniffles meekly, wipes a fugitive tear from her cheek. Truman and Hayward stare with
surprise, enthralled. Andy emits a little pleading sigh. And Tremayne speaks with quiet
reverence, speaks for all of them:
TREMAYNE
(sotto voce)
"Oh she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems
she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an
Ethiope's ear; Beauty too rich for use, for earth too
dear!"
HOLD ON this tableau for a beat. The rare beauty. The swooning admirers.
DISSOLVE TO:





 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT
Moments later. Lucy returns to her post through the now empty lobby. She looks about,
reacts, picks up an incoming call.
LUCY
Sheriffs Station, how can I help you? One moment,
please.
(patching in)
Sheriff Truman? Sheriff
(puzzled, she gets up, walks to his office door,
knocks)
Sheriff?
No reply. Lucy leans closer, she can hear LAUGHTER from inside. She opens the door.
 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

MATCH WITH:

Lucy stands in the doorway.
Sheriff?

LUCY

Lana Budding sits on the Sheriffs desk surrounded by ardent suitors. Truman, Doc Hayward,
Andy, Hawk and Tremayne. Sweetly, in mid-tale:
LANA
... and so then I said, "But what do you think underpants
are for, anyway?"
The men react with laughter and affection. All eyes upon her. Tremayne leans closer.
TREMAYNE
Tell us another one. Please, Lana?
HAYWARD
C'mon, Lana. One more.
TRUMAN
Quiet, guys. Give her some room.
LANA
Okay. One time I had this cousin who was a clown in
this rodeo and there was all these really big horses ...
Andy leaps up to refill Lana's glass. Lucy reacts with rolling eyes, revulsion. But no one even
notices as she pivots, slams the door behind her. A beat. And the mounted deer head creaks,
tilts, and SMASHES down on a vacant chair. Only seconds after Andy left it. HOLD ON
Andy's near-miss for a beat.

 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
ED HURLEY sits at the counter, drags a fork through a piece of cherry pie. He's quiet, sad.
NORMA'S VOICE
(gentle humor)
Are you going to eat that pie, or push it all over my
china?
Ed looks up, sees NORMA JENNINGS standing there.
ED
I'm not all that hungry.
NORMA
Want to talk about it?
ED
You don't want to hear my troubles.
NORMA
We used to talk about everything. We still can, Ed.
A long beat. Ed just looks at her. She's still the woman he loves.
ED
Remember when we were kids? Al the plans we made
It was like we were waiting for our lives to begin.
Planning all the stuff we'd do when they did. But
somehow, life starts before you know it. And suddenly
you're halfway through living it, and all those plans don't
mean a thing.
(beat)
I'm living my life, Norma. I don't like it much.
Norma reaches down, takes his hand. A beat. Ed brings Norma's palm to his lips, gently
kisses it. As if to find refuge there.
NORMA
(whispered)
Maybe we can make new plans.
Ed looks up at Norma, hopeful. Norma smiles. But CAMERA REVEALS someone
watching them from the kitchen with dark, angry eyes. Hank Jennings.

 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Ernie Niles dines alone. He lifts fork to mouth, stops half-way. Denise Bryson suddenly sits
across from him.
ERNIE
Can I help you ...?
Denise produces the photographs from Dead Dog Farm, tosses them onto the table. Shows
Ernie her i.d. and badge.
DENISE
Mr. Niles, I'm not going to put the squeeze on. You've
been to prison, I don't need to paint you any pictures.
ERNIE
Wha - what are you talking about?
DENISE
For starters you're guilty of a serious parole violation.
Enough to put you back inside. And unless you
cooperate, I'll do everything in my power to keep you
there.
ERNIE
(sinking fast)
What do you want me to do?
HOLD ON poor Ernie. Sweating bullets.
 INT. AGENT COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

CUT TO:

Ernie spills his guts with gusto. Not to mention the usual lies and exaggerations.
ERNIE
My name is Ernie Niles. I confess. I'm guilty.
Terribly guilty. Against my will, of course ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Niles, Denise, and Agent Cooper in the latter's hotel room.
Mr. Niles -

DENISE

ERNIE
They held me at gunpoint, they beat me and made
violent threats. These men are animals, they'll stop at
nothing Mr. Niles -

COOPER



 




ERNIE 
They want me to sell drugs for them, I tried to resist,
but family is all important to me and when they
threatened my family, when they threatened my wife, I
weakened, I'm sorry, I know it was wrong, but love
makes a man do foolish things, illegal things,
sometimes ERNIE!!

DENISE

That catches his attention. Ernie pauses, cowers just a bit. Cooper's cool and calm.
COOPER
Ernie, we appreciate the trials you have suffered. We
Sympathize. That's why we're here.
You are?

ERNIE

DENISE
Yes. Now tell us everything you know.
ERNIE
(off to the races)
They tortured me. Horrid, awful humiliations. I tried
to be strong, I swear, but a man can only stand so much
pain COOPER
Not everything. Just those details that pertain to the
selling of drugs.
A beat. Ernie takes a deep breath, pulls himself together. Then:
ERNIE
They have five kilos of cocaine to sell. They need a
buyer. To save myself, I told them I could find one.
Have you?

COOPER

ERNIE
(the liar confesses)
God, no, I don't know anybody who could do that.
DENISE
You do now. A major drug trafficker will arrive from
Seattle tomorrow. You will set up a meet with these
men at Dead Dog Farm.

ERNIE
But with who? Who is It?
DENISE
You're looking at him.

Him?

ERNIE
(fatally confused)

(Denise nods)
May I be excused for a minute? Nervous bladder.
Cooper nods. Ernie shuffles off to the bathroom.
DENISE
You were right. The cocaine you found at the farm
matches what I found in your car.
COOPER
The frame-up.
DENISE
Jean Renault. A crooked Mountie. They almost had
you, Coop.
COOPER
Almost. Now it's our turn.
Cooper smiles.
 INT. GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

CUT TO:

James tosses and turns in his bed, then stops suddenly, listens. Voices shouting in the night.
James hurries to the window that faces the main house. The sounds continue, but more
ambiguous now. A fight? Some more innocent disturbance? There's no way for James to be
sure. Just then: footsteps approaching. James turns: Malcom steps into the room. He drinks
deeply from a tall glass, steps toward the window to peer back at the main house. Quietly drunk.
JAMES
Is she alright?
MALCOM
The first time he beat her, I swore revenge. Something
violent and noble. Evelyn begged me not to hurt him.
She made me promise. For both our sakes. That was
four years ago.
(beat)
With each succeeding violation, my heart's torn into even
smaller pieces. And one day ... I swear I'll kill him.




 



MALCOM 
No matter what it costs.

Malcom turns from the window, faces James. Moonlight illuminates the tears upon his face.
CUT TO:

 INT. BRIGGS HOUSE - NIGHT

Bobby Briggs steps carefully through the dark living room. Then he stops, SEES someone
sitting in an armchair. Startled, Bobby lets out a whoop and leaps backward. The figure
reaches for a standing lamp, turns it on. Revealing Bobby's mother, BETTY BRIGGS.
BOBBY
Jeez, Mom. You almost gave me a heart attack.
I'm sorry.

BETTY

BOBBY
What are you doin' alone in the dark.
BETTY
Nothing. Just sitting here.
BOBBY
Well read a book or something, will you. It's creepy.
(pause; takes a closer look)
It's Dad, right?
Betty nods, bites her lip. A beat. And Bobby steps to her, kneels at his mother's side.
BOBBY
Hey. He's coming back. You know he will. This is just
some of that top secret jazz.
BETTY
I'm not so sure this time.
Betty begins to cry. Bobby pauses. He doesn't know what to do. Then, a little awkward:
BOBBY
Guess you really love him, huh?
BETTY
(simply)
Completely.
Bobby sits down, leans against the chair. He reaches into his jacket for a cigarette. Lights it.
Knowing his mother will not protest. A long beat, then, quietly, almost contemplative:






 
BOBBY
I was at the Double R last week. Dad and I, we had this
talk. About this dream he had. There was this big
house, with lots of lights, made of white marble. Dad
was there, and I was there too. Living a life of "deep
harmony and joy." Something like that. And there was
all this stuff about my future. Good stuff. Kind'a nuts.
But it was cool.
BETTY
Your father is an extraordinary man.
BOBBY
My father is a deeply weird individual.
(quietly, with affection)
He has a lot more goin' on under his hat than most
people. That's for sure.
Betty smiles. Bobby's not far wrong.
BETTY
(quietly)
When I sleep at night, he runs his fingers through my hair.
He doesn't think I notice. But I do.
Just then: a noise from the front door. Both react, and MAJOR BRIGGS walks into the living
room noticeably disheveled. There's a faint, almost imperceptible glow in his eyes. Bobby
and Betty Briggs react with stunned silence. Briggs finally speaks:
BRIGGS
(a little foggy)
How long have I been gone?
Two days.

BETTY

BRIGGS
Strange. It seemed much shorter.
Betty Briggs rushes into his arms. Bobby gets to his feet. He's not up to a hug. But Bobby can't
help but exhibit a little relief. Briggs speaks to him over his wife's shoulder.
BRIGGS 
Bobby, I want you to put out that cigarette. Then I
would like you to fix me a cocktail. A strong one, if you
don't mind.






 (2)
BOBBY
(a little dazed)
Sure, Dad. Whatever you say.
Bobby steps off into the shadows. Briggs and his wife remain in loving embrace, illuminated
by the warm light of the standing lamp. She weeps quietly.
BETTY
Is everything all right?
BRIGGS
No dear. Not exactly.
FADE TO BLACK.
END ACT FOUR



ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1A. EXT. WOODS - DAY

MAJOR BRIGGS sits in an armchair in the middle of a fog forest clearing. It's an odd
image. As if it occurred inside his mind. Briggs' moods shifts with great alacrity, alternating
between inchoate rambling and coherence, as if someone had popped his mental cork.
BRIGGS
I ... I remember stepping from the flames, a vague shape
in the dark ... then nothing. Until I found myself standing
by the cold remains of our campfire. Two days later.
VOICES enter the Major's dreamscape. Dr. Hayward and Agent Cooper.
HAYWARD'S VOICE
Major, there are some new therapeutic techniques that
might help us to break through your amnesia.
BRIGGS
My memories are immune to regression. I can feel
them, they are palpable. The smell and sensations...
everything is known to me. Yet somehow beyond my
reach.
COOPER'S VOICE
Do you remember anything else?
BRIGGS
Very little. Save for one disturbing image. A giant
owl. Pervasive.
COOPER'S VOICE
A giant owl. How big?
SUDDENLY: a flash of blinding LIGHT, the image of a screeching OWL flying fast
and low, and a second FLASH leading us to...
CUT TO:


INT. SHERIFF'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Briggs seated in the same armchair inside the conference room. AGENT COOPER and
SHERIFF TRUMAN gather around him. DR. HAYWARD completes a physical exam, has
just snapped a poloroid of the Major's head - hence the second FLASH of light.
BRIGGS
(answering Cooper's query)
Enough to cloud my mind and memory.

HAYWARD
(receiving undeveloped print, reporting his
findings)
Three triangular scars behind his right ear. In perfect
proportion.
TRUMAN
(still the skeptic)
Major Briggs, exactly what kind of work do you do?
BRIGGS
That information is, as I have repeated endlessly to
myself ... classified. Though the keeping of secrets
seems less meaningful to me now.
(his mind wanders)
Perhaps there are sources of information that transcend
the human need to conspire. Information of such weight
that it pertains not to the ...
(struggling, emotional)
My God, is this meant for the soul, my soul ...?
COOPER
(gentle prompting)
Maybe you should start at the beginning.
BRIGGS
(after a beat)
Are you familiar with Project Blue Book?
COOPER
The Air Force project dedicated to the investigation of
Unidentified Flying Objects.
BRIGGS
(pulling himself together)
Officially disbanded in 1969. But there are those of us
who continue in an unofficial capacity. Examining the
heavens as before. And, in the case of Twin Peaks, the
earth below.
(beat)
We are searching for a place called the White Lodge Cooper reacts, remembers Hawk's stories. But before he can answer... a knock at the door,
followed by the entrance of two stern UNIFORMED MP'S.
MP #1
Major Briggs?


.1
1.




(2)
BRIGGS
(almost relieved)
I've been expecting you.

Briggs rises to join them. The MP's mean to escort him to the door. Truman protests.
TRUMAN
Now wait just one minute...
MP #1
Colonel Reilly's orders.
BRIGGS (mediating)
I'm afraid we will have to continue this discussion at a
later date. Goodbye.
With that, the MP's lead Briggs from the room. Hayward looks at the poloroid, now
developed. He hands it to Agent Cooper. Three scars behind the Majors right ear in perfect
proportion. Just then: a drop of WATER falls from above, splatters upon the image From a
fire sprinkler overhead. Just like the one that heralded Bob's flight to freedom.


HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
ERNIE NILES stares at the telephone on Truman's desk as if, it was his worst enemy.
DENISE BRYSON stands nearby, gestures toward it.
DENISE
Go ahead, Ernie. It won't bite.
ERNIE
(rising, and lying, to the occasion)
A lot you know. We're dealing with a murderous thug
here. Not that I haven't had plenty of dealings with his
kind before. Jean Renault is a hard man, but I've known
men who'd make him quiver Ernie.

DENISE

ERNIE
All right, all right, all right.
Ernie picks up the receiver. Just then: Cooper and Truman step into the room. Startled, Ernie
returns the receiver to its cradle with a resounding SLAM.

Sorry.

TRUMAN
(re unexpected entrance)

COOPER
Setting the buy?
DENISE
Trying to. Ernie's a little gunshy.
ERNIE (insulted)
Gunshy? Ernie Niles is bold as bold can be. Let me at
him.
(he reaches for the phone, then a sudden gear shift)
Please don't make me do this. This is suicide. I know.
I'm begging you, please. I don't want to. I'm begging.
Denise deadpans, gestures toward the telephone. A long beat. Ernie sighs, dials. Someone
answers. He pales a bit, pauses, then, meekly:
ERNIE
May I please speak to Jean Renault?


CUT TO:

A STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

Deputy ANDY BRENNEN enters a corridor, finds Tremayne waiting for him.
TREMAYNE
Andrew, where have you been?
Cat in tree.

ANDY

TREMAYNE
A peace officer's work is never done. Lucky for us my
efforts bore more palatable fruit.
(proudly imparts a great secret)
I paid the Happy Helping Hand adoption agency a visit
where several blue-haired ladies were only too happy to
sup from my open palm. Unfortunately, all of Little
Nicky's records had been sealed and returned to the
Orphanage.
ANDY
We'll never know what really happened to Little Nicky's
parents.
TREMAYNE
Courage, Andrew. Do not despair. Next stop: that
selfsame Orphanage. And Little Nicky's records
within.

ANDY
(getting cold feet)
Maybe we should tell Lucy.
TREMAYNE
Absolutely not. Our investigation into Nicky's past
must proceed sub rosa. This, dear boy, is strictly a
man's job.
(putting on his best Holmesian visage)
Follow me.
Andy and Tremayne exit. Lucy peeks out of her cubicle, curious. All she SEES is Agent
Cooper as he approaches. Cooper wonders:
COOPER
Any luck, Lucy?
LUCY
I checked the personals columns in every national
newspaper on the list and I didn't find anything that
looked like a chess thing or any mention of the name
Windom Earle. Sorry.
Cooper gives Lucy an encouraging pat, and turns toward the door.

ED HURLEY finishes breakfast at the counter. NORMA JENNINGS hands him his check.
The latter occurs under the watchful eye of HANK JENNINGS, standing to the rear.
NORMA
(she knows Hank is watching)
Everything all right, Ed?
ED
(so does he)
Just fine, thanks. For you.
Ed rises, hands her a bill. And a NOTE beneath it. Norma reacts, tucks the note into her apron.










NORMA
(as gently as the situation allows)
'Bye now

They exchange a meaningful glance. Ed exits. And behind them, his eyes dark with anger and
suspicion, Hank watches every single move.


MIKE AT THE COUNTER
MIKE NELSON enjoys a morning cup of coffee. His respite is shattered by the sudden
appearance of NADINE HURLEY at the stool beside him.
NADINE
Good morning, Mike Nelson!
MIKE
(muttered)
Oh, Lord.
NADINE
Wanna share a soda? How about a nice big piece of
cherry pie. Two forks.
MIKE
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine, I want my own piece of cherry pie.
In fact, I want two pieces of cherry pie for myself
NADINE
Okay. Meat loaf!
MIKE
(anger rising)
Cherry pie and coffee. In fact, sixteen cups of coffee.
(at Nadine)
I don't want to talk with you. I don't want to walk with
you. I don't want to see you. I don't want to know you.
Is that clear enough to understand? Or will I need a
court order to get my point across?
A long beat. Nadine's worldview severely challenged. She bows her head for a beat,
chastised. Then looks up, the light of love not yet extinguished in her eyes.
NADINE
Mike Nelson you are the handsomest boy I've ever
known. And I would really like it if you and I could go
out on a date.
A beat of stunned silence. Suddenly - Nadine gives Mike a kiss. Deep, much deeper than he
has ever been kissed before. And more sexual than the kisses of a hundred high school girls.








(2)
Finally, Nadine releases him, beams.
NADINE
Sorry. Sometimes I can't help myself.
Mike pauses, stunned. By both the kiss ... and how much he liked it.



CUT TO:

HANK JENNINGS

HANK enters from the kitchen, carrying an order. He pauses to watch NORMA
JENNINGS grab car keys and purse from a shelf beneath the register.
HANK
Where're you headed?
NORMA
I've got a couple errands.
HANK
(friendly)
Little early for errands, isn't it? We've still got most of
the breakfast crowd.
NORMA
(ditto)
Think of this as a test, Hank. Just you, an a kitchen full
of scrambled eggs. I'll be right back.
Norma exits. Hank watches her go. She lied to him and he knows it.

Dammit. It's your turn to feed him.
BOBBY BRIGGS, seated opposite, looks up from his paper. Like a beleaguered husband no
longer satisfied with happy memories.

BOBBY

I got practice.
SHELLY
Football season is over.
BOBBY
This is baseball, baby. Our national pastime.
SHELLY
Okay. Then you can wash him when you get back.
BOBBY
(throwing down paper, getting to his feet)
I'm not coming back.
SHELLY
What did you say?
BOBBY
You're lookin' at Ben Horne's brand new boy. Do the
words "golden opportunity" mean anything to you? This
is my big break. And I've got better things to do than
give Leo Johnson a bubble bath.
SHELLY
And what about me? Don't I have anything better to do?
BOBBY
Not that I can think of.
He didn't mean it. Shelly SLAPS him hard across the face. Bobby stares at her for a beat.
Then turns and walks out the door. Shelly yells after:

 INT./EXT. MARSH GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO:

JAMES HURLEY at the garage phone. He dials, waits.
JAMES
(after a beat)
Uncle Ed? Yeah, it's me ... I'm okay. Listen. I need a
favor. Get the money out of my savings account,
whatever's left. And send it care of me to The Broken
Bones, it's a bar out on ..

James senses someone close by, looks up. It's EVELYN MARSH, standing quite still in the
garage doorway. She wears dark sunglasses. James stares at her for a beat, returns to Big Ed on
the phone.
JAMES 
... I can't explain. I'll call you later. Got to go.
James lowers the receiver from his lips. Evelyn steps closer, she smiles.
EVELYN
Long distance?
Twin Peaks.

JAMES

EVELYN
Are you homesick, James?
No.

JAMES

Evelyn runs her hand along the Jaguar's sleek lines. As she approaches, James can see a bruise
beneath her right eye. A wound the sunglasses cannot completely hide.
EVELYN
Tell me about Twin Peaks.
JAMES
(reticent)
There isn't much to say.
EVELYN
You could start with why you left. A woman, as I recall.
Two of them.
Evelyn's keeping it light. A gentle flirtation. James responds quietly, lets a secret out of his
heart.
JAMES
(after a long beat)
I loved a girl who died.
Evelyn stops still to face him.
JAMES 
Her name was Laura. I thought I knew her but I didn't.
Nobody did.







 (2)
I'm sorry.

EVELYN

JAMES
(the feelings rush back)
My life used to make sense, you know? I didn't like it
all the time. But it was mine and I felt like it belonged
to me. Then Laura died. And the whole world went
crazy. Suddenly my life belonged to something else.
To Laura. And no matter what I did, or how much I
tried to help, and I tried, I really did...

Another girl died. And all I wanted to do was get on
my bike and ride as far away from Twin Peaks as it
would take me.
James pauses, deeply shaken. Evelyn steps to him, takes James into her arms. A long beat.
She whispers:
EVELYN
(genuine compassion)
I know the feeling, James. I know the feeling.
Their mouths come closer together, awkward, shy. They kiss. James gently removes her
sunglasses. He wants to see into her eyes. A long beat. James traces the bruise on her check
with his fingertips.
JAMES
Why do you let him hurt you?
Evelyn takes his hand, presses it against her lips. She will not answer. Instead, she kisses James
with great passion. Their embrace deepens. Suddenly: the SOUND of a car pulling up the drive.
Evelyn steps out of James' arms, looks to the main house. MALCOM steps out of a limousine,
pauses to shoot a warning glance in their direction. Then proceeds inside.
EVELYN
Jeffrey's leaving.
Evelyn turns back to James, whispers before leaving.
EVELYN
I need you. Will you help me?
Evelyn hurries out of the garage without waitin for an answer. HOLD ON James for a beat.
Considering his reply.

JOSIE PACKARD answers a knock at the kitchen door. It's Sheriff Truman.
Harry.

TRUMAN
Two days, Josie. Two nights. And not a word.
I'm sorry.

JOSIE

TRUMAN
What the hell are you doing here?
JOSIE
(quiet and afraid)
This is my home.
TRUMAN
After everything you told me? Home with Catherine?!
JOSIE
I have no choice.
Josie turns from him, she cannot bear his gaze. But he reaches after, pulls her into his arms.
TRUMAN
Let me take care of you. Please.
JOSIE
Don't you understand? I'm safe here. And you are safe as
well.
No.

TRUMAN

JOSIE
(pulling free from his arms)
Look at me. I am Catherine Packard's maid.
(a quiet shudder)
Go away, Harry. I'm no good for you now.
Truman steps closer, he sees the servant's clothing, the tears that shine in her eyes.
TRUMAN
I want you. Good or bad. I don't care.

Truman reaches for her blouse, unfastens it.

ACT TWO
FADE IN:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY

AUDREY HORNE wanders down the corridor outside her father's office. She pauses, hears
Ben shouting inside.
BEN'S VOICE
Dammit, Longstreet. We may have come to this
godforsaken town in search of shoes, but we will leave it
with Grant on his knees, and our sights set on
Washington!
Audrey reacts, steps toward the office door.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO:

Audrey enters, finds an amazing tableau within. BEN HORNE has transformed the floor of
his office into a huge diorama depicting the Battle of Gettysburg, complete with rolling hills,
tiny trees, miniature soldiers in uniform. And a chugging train that hoots about the periphery.
Lost in combat, Ben holds two toy soldiers, continues a conversation between them. Ben is
dressed in the requisite finery of a Southern General.
BEN
(as toy soldier, Longstreet)
Yessir, General Lee.
(as Lee)
Longstreet, I want you to lead the assault on the Round
Tops. Ewell will take Culp's Hill AUDREY
(can't believe her eyes and ears)
Daddy ... ?
BEN
(as Lee, raging)
Yes, Culp's Hill, are you deaf? And where's Jeb Stuart
and his calvary?! Damn his eyes!!
(as Longstreet)
Jeb's a-comin', Sir. I know it.
(as Lee)
He'd better be. For all our sakes. We meet the enemy
here. And we meet him by morning.
DADDY!!

AUDREY

Horne freezes, looks up from battle. Wild-eyed and disheveled.







 
BEN
(a sudden calm)
Suddenly it's daybreak.
AUDREY
What in the world are you doing?
BEN
THERE'S A CIVIL WAR GOING ON HERE.

War?

AUDREY
(voice breaking, truly concerned)

BEN
The war between the states. And who are you?
AUDREY
Audrey, your daughter, and you need some help.
BEN
Thank you but I just want to be left alone, this is an
important day.
AUDREY
This is an important day, alright, we've got a business to
save. You and me. And I am going to help you.
BEN
(a long pause)
Audrey?
AUDREY
(hopeful)
Yes, Daddy?
BEN
(back to the races)
You're standing on General Stuart.
She moves. Ben snatches the soldier from under her feet.
BEN
We spotted ol' Jeb, General Lee. He brought us a
hundred and twenty-five wagons.
(as Lee)

BEN 
Fool, I have no use for wagons! I need my eyes and ears
beside me. Bring me General Stuart!! Ready the good
men of the Alabama 15th!! On to Victory!!

Audrey can't believe it. She holds back a sob, turns and runs from the office. Leaving her
father - and the Civil War - behind. Ben doesn't notice.
CUT TO:
 INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
BIG ED HURLEY steps nervously about the living room, checks a clock on the knickknack
shelf. Just then: a KNOCK at the door. Ed answers it. Norma steps inside, still wearing her
Double R uniform. An awkward beat. Neither sure just what to say or do. Then:
ED
Norma, I've been thinking NORMA
(simultaneously)
Ed, I came here so I could ED
(after a beat)
You first.
NORMA
(deep breath, with loving surety)
Okay. When I go to bed, you're the last thing I think of.
When I wake up, you're the first thing on
my mind. I know the world's gone to pieces. And I
know it all seems designed to keep us apart. But there's
one thing bad luck never takes into account. We love
each other, Ed. And I think we have to stand up to that.
No matter what.
A beat. Ed takes her into his arms, they kiss deeply.
NORMA
(between kisses)
Your turn.
(he keeps kissing her)
Ed?

Later.

ED
(unbuttoning her uniform)

Norma smiles, returns his kisses with greater fervor.

 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

START CLOSE on hands attaching a hidden microphone to a rather sweaty chest. A
protesting voice is heard. Ernie Niles.
ERNIE'S VOICE
Careful. Watch the chest hair. Ouch.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Sheriff Truman, Agent Cooper. And DEPUTY HAWK
fitting Niles with the wire, putting baby powder on his chest.
HAWK
(just an observation)
You're sweating like a pig, Mr. Niles.
NILES
(no offense taken)
I suffer from nervous perspiration. Hyperhidrosis. It's a
childhood condition. Though I never really noticed it
until the war ...
(oh what the hell, why not lie)
... Korea. I was leading a battalion toward the fortyninth parallel. Just a bunch of young, fresh-faced kids,
no idea what kind of hell we were about to step into COOPER
Ernie? Ernie, I want you focus on the here and now.
Repeat your instructions. Step by step.
ERNIE
(after a beat, a little hushed)
I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm, introduce her to
Renault as a big-time buyer from Seattle. I lead
Renault through the buy. Complete the transaction. And
get the hell out of the way.
COOPER
Good. Harry? You'll take it from there.
(off his confident nod)
Wish I could go in with you, but I've temporarily lost
my enforcement franchise.






 
TRUMAN
I've been giving that some thought.
Truman reveals a Twin Peaks DEPUTY'S BADGE, hands it toward him.
TRUMAN
Consider yourself deputized. The Bureau's loss is my
gain.
COOPER
Thank you, Harry. I hope I can live up to it.
HAWK
I'm done. Might want to towel him off before we go.
ERNIE
(growing increasingly nervous)
Just how long will it take you to storm the farmhouse? I
mean from the time I complete the buy? Maybe I
should be wearing a vest. Can I ask a question?
Sure, Ernie.

TRUMAN

ERNIE
(entering collapse)
Don't make me do this. Please. I'm not the man you
think I am. I'm a coward. Really. This isn't my line of
work, I (he notices the stern looks from all)
I'm fine. Sorry. A momentary lapse. Count on me.
COOPER
(with a sigh, to Truman)
Where's Denise?
Just then: Denise, or rather Dennis, enters the room. She's reverted back to male dress for the
occasion, hair tied neatly back in a ponytail.
DENISE/DENNIS
Right here.
(all turn to regard her. A beat, then)
Somehow it seemed ... appropriate.
Cooper offers an unfazed thumbs up.

 INT. ORPHANAGE OFFICE -DAY
An empty office. Two or three cluttered desks. A series of file cabinets. Suddenly, the
sound of heated whispers outside, shadows playing across the office door's opaque window.
TREMAYNE'S VOICE
(with requisite drama)
We may have to pick the lock. Tricky business, that.
Just then: the door opens, REVEALING Tremayne and Andy on the other side. Andy has
simply turned the knob of the unlocked door.
TREMAYNE
(deadpan)
Voila. We enter.
ANDY
Where is everybody?
TREMAYNE

Lunch.
(opening file cabinet)
Here we are ... the case files.
Tremayne leafs through the cabinet, reading names as he goes.
TREMAYNE
Nails, Neaster, Neatherby, Needleman. Nicholas
Needleman. Our little Nicky.
ANDY
(nervous, standing watch at door)
We can read it in the car.
TREMAYNE
(looking through the file)
Patience, Andrew ... Hmm. The usual background
information. Birthplace, initial adoption.

Dick.

ANDY
(hissing)

TREMAYNE
The first of several, it seems. A-ha, the plot thickens.
Where are thy secrets, Little Nicky?

DICK.

ANDY
(now panicked)



 




Tremayne turns to the door. He sees a KINDLY COUPLE, the pleasant-faced HUSBAND.
Tremayne panicks, slams the file back inside the cabinet, banging his finger in the process.
HUSBAND
Hi. We're the Brunston's. I know we're a little early.
But we were just so damn eager to see him ...
(off their confusion)
Can we see him? Where is Donnie?
Speechless, Andy simply points at Tremayne. Tremayne faces the unexpected guests, replies:

Dead.

TREMAYNE
(thinking on his feet)

The husband pales, the wife gasps. Tremayne improvises further.
TREMAYNE
Dead tired, that is. I'm afraid Donnie isn't feeling up to
snuff.
HUSBAND
But he was in perfect health, yesterday.

Dick.

ANDY
(looking out door, footsteps in the hall)

TREMAYNE
Just one minute. Let me help these good people. Now
where were we..?
Tremayne looks up at the inquisitive couple a supplicating look on his face.

I love you, Norma. I'm hard pressed to think of
anything else that matters.
Norma smiles, kisses the arms that hold her. Suddenly: a KNOCK at the door. Both react.
CUT TO:






 INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
Ed opens the door, finds DONNA HAYWARD standing there.
DONNA
I need your help, Ed.
ED
What can I do for you?
DONNA
I've been looking for James everywhere. He hasn't been
in school. No one's seen him at the Diner. I even went
to his house but I can't find him.
ED
Donna. Listen to me. James is all right. He called.
Tell me.

DONNA (impassioned)

ED (taking out an envelope)
James asked me to send him some money care of a bar
out on  We didn't talk long ...
(showing envelope to her)
That's all I know.
Donna peers at the envelope for a beat. An address written there.
DONNA
Let me take it to him.
ED
What about your folks?
DONNA
I'll speak to them. They'll understand.
Ed's not so sure, but Donna doesn't hesitate. She gives Ed a kiss on the cheek, exits. Ed pauses,
turns back to the bedroom. Norma's standing in the doorway. Both listen to the sound of
Donna's car driving away.
NORMA
I've got to get back.
I'll call.

ED

Norma steps into his arms, they kiss.







 
NORMA (a loving promise)
We've got a lot to talk about.
Norma exits. Ed pauses to watch her go. Then, at last, he closes the door, turns back to the
living room ... and finds Hank Jennings standing before him.
HANK
(murderous and cold)
Oh, Ed. The things we do for love.
Hank SLAMS his fist into Ed's jaw. Ed topples over backward. Hank leaps upon him. He'll
beat him to death if he can. Just then: someone OPENS the front door. Norma returning?
No. It's Nadine, carrying a satchel of books. Thinking about Mike. Thinking about Ed.
Thinking about her parents in Europe.
NADINE
Eddie? I'm home!
Nadine SEES Hank and Big Ed. One looming over the other.
Eddie?

NADINE

Hank turns to Nadine, revealing Ed below him, face bloodied and battered. Nadine reacts in
a flash. She leaps forward, swings her book satchel like a scimitar, bashing Hank in the head.
Hank yowls in protest, tries to avoid. But Nadine is stronger and faster than his darkest
nightmare. And now she turns the full force of her anger upon him.
Nadine batters Hank through the living room, pile-driving into a coffee table, hurling
him through the knickknack shelf, and with one last great punch...sends him careening over the
sofa. A beat of stunned silence. Hank lies still. Nadine hurries to Big Ed's side.
NADINE
(cradling him in her arms)
Eddie? Can you hear me?
ED
(eyes fluttering open)
Nadine?
NADINE
Nadine's here. Don't worry, baby. Nadine will take

 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

A victorious Ben Horne, still in military raiment, eyes the battleground before him. Bobby
Briggs looks on with a sinking feeling. His big break is turning to sand before his eyes.
BEN
Colonel Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were trapped
at the summit of Little Round Top. A third of his men
already fallen. His one chance, his only chance, was to
take the offensive; to move his left flank down the
hillside, like a swinging gate and take us by surprise.
BOBBY (maybe he can break thru the fog)
Uh, Mr. Horne..?
BEN
But we were waiting for him. The 15th Alabama
attacked before the left flank was able to muster.
Chamberlain's desperate manuever ended in failure
(an arm around Bobby)
Little Round Top was ours. From this vantage point, we
were able to roll back the Federal line, setting the stage
for Pickett's mighty charge. And victory.
BOBBY
Victory. Oh boy.
Bobby looks to the door, Audrey peeking inside. He shrugs. What can I do? Meanwhile, Ben
produces a sword from behind his desk, hands it to Bobby with great fanfare.
BEN
General Meade, you have suffered in ignoble defeat. I
accept your unconditional surrender.
Bobby doesn't know what the hell to do. Ben wants him to hand the sword back.
BEN
General Meade. I accept your unconditional surrender.
BOBBY
(backing from the room)
Okay. Tell you what, Mr. Horne, I gotta go check with
President Lincoln first, okay? So you wait right here,








 
BOBBY 
and we'll get back to you on this surrender thing - hey,
don't wanna keep the President waiting.
Bobby makes a hasty exit, holding the sword.
CUT TO:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY
Bobby exits from the office carrying the ceremonial sword, finds Audrey outside. They walk
down the corridor together.
BOBBY
Baby, I got good news and I got bad news. The bad
news is your old man just bought a condo in Flip City.
Ben is out to lunch. The good news is he's about to win
the Civil War.
AUDREY
(wheels already turning)
I'll call Uncle Jerry. He'Il know what to do. And
Doctor Jacoby. Maybe he needs an injection. Bobby, I
don't care what it takes: we've got to get Ben Horne back
on his feet again.
BOBBY
(willing to play along)
Okay, baby. Whatever you say. Bobby's on the case.
That may work with Shelly. But not this girl. She deadpans:
AUDREY
Don't call me baby.
They turn the corner. Catherine Martell, who's overheard some of the exchange, steps around
the corner and heads for the office.
CUT TO:
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ben sits on the couch, enjoys a victory cigar. Someone knocks at the office door.
Enter lively.

BEN






 
The door opens ... Catherine Martell steps inside.
Hello, Ben.

CATHERINE

Ben reacts. She's a walking reality check, tearing Ben from fantasy's comforting embrace.
Catherine.

BEN

CATHERINE
(pause, eyes on diorama, an educated guess)
Gettysburg?

Yes ...

BEN
(uncertain how to greet her)

CATHERINE
(accurately interpreting the battle results)
Only you could conceive of winning the Civil War. For the South.
BEN
I have Washington in my sights.
CATHERINE
You have the nuthouse in your future if you don't snap out
of it.
BEN
(reluctantly considering reality)
So you've come to gloat. Come to celebrate my
demise. Go ahead, then. Laugh. You've defeated me.
Left me for dead. As I have defeated General Meade.
There's something wistful in Ben's expression. A kind of vulnerability Catherine's never seen
before. Catherine looks at Ben for a beat. Then, a little wistful herself.
CATHERINE
True. I did come here to gloat. You double-crossed me.
You tried to kill me. And I, for the very best of reasons,
intended to bury you so deeply that future generations
would someday unearth and exhibit your remains:
Slimey Rat Bastard Americanus: DO NOT FEED.
DO NOT TRUST.

BEN
(he whispers)
I'm not all that trustworthy, I suppose.
CATHERINE
Far from it. And yet, despite all the things I know,
despite every reason you've given me to despise you ... I
find myself here with you ... wanting you.
BEN
You can't be serious ...
CATHERINE
I want you, Ben. Horrifying as it seems. I can't escape
it. You ... make my body hum.
Ben looks at her, speechless. Catherine reaches for him.
CATHERINE
Now kiss me, General Lee.
Catherine pushes Ben down upon the soft couch. Both sides engage.
 EXT. MARSH GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO:

Evelyn stands outside the garage, holding a bottle of champagne and two glasses. Eyes closed,
she waits; giddy, impatient.
EVELYN
(teasing)
Hurry up, "Jim." The champagne's getting warm.
JAMES' VOICE
(from inside the garage)
Don't call me "Jim."
Suddenly: the ROAR of an engine from the garage. Evelyn opens her eyes. And James drives
into view behind the wheel of the gleaming Jaguar. Evelyn holds the champagne and glasses
into the air, triumphant. James pulls up beside her. He opens the passenger door, steps into
view. Presents the automobile with a grinning flourish.
JAMES
Anyplace special you want to go?
EVELYN
(in kind)
Jeffrey'll be home by midnight. That doesn't give us a
lot of time.








 
JAMES
(quiet and shy)
I'll take what we got.

Deal.

EVELYN
(stepping toward him)

James and Evelyn meet at the front of the Jaguar. The engine running. Evelyn pours two
glasses, hands one to James. They touch glasses. Evelyn proposes a toast.
EVELYN
(not coy)
To handsome strangers and rebuilt engines.
James downs his glass with a flourish. Evelyn grins, does the same.
EVELYN
I never thought I'd see it ride again. You're a miracleworker.
JAMES
It was nothing. Honest.
EVELYN
You're too modest.
JAMES
I don't want to brag.
EVELYN
(keeping it light)
Oh, go ahead. You deserve it. You're strong and you're
kind. You have a wonderfully honest face, James. Don't
laugh, it's quite rare. Every time I look at you, I can tell
exactly what you're thinking.
JAMES
Guess I ought to be careful about what I'm thinking.
EVELYN
(shifting emotional gears)
Don't be careful. Not on my account.
Evelyn pours herself another glass, hands the bottle to James.
EVELYN
What are your plans?

JAMES
I haven't thought about it.
EVELYN

JAMES

EVELYN

What?

JAMES

EVELYN
(now looking into his eyes)
I don't want you to leave. Give me time, James. I'll
think of a hundred reasons for you to stay.
Evelyn kisses him. Their passion increases. James begins to remove her blouse. Evelyn reaches
for his belt. James eases her down upon on the Jaguar hood, the engine still running hot beneath
them. Evelyn smiles, giddy, she whispers:
EVELYN

It 's warm.
HOLD ON James and Evelyn for a beat. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Malcolm watching
from the garage. And he's smiling.

Deputy Hawk sits in a police cruiser, wearing a headset, manning the radio and taping controls.
Sheriff Truman and Agent Cooper recline atop a small bluff, peer through binoculars at Dead
Dog Farm. Both wear portable earpieces. INTERCUT their POV as they watch and listen

ERNIE'S VOICE
You sure you don't want to wait for Hank? He told me
this morning how much he wanted to be in on everything.
I feel pretty strongly we should wait a couple more RENAULT'S VOICE
We'll start without him.
ERNIE'S VOICE
(instant collapse)
Whatever you say. Dennis ... ?
May I?

DENNIS'S VOICE

RENAULT'S VOICE
(suspicious)
You're sweating awful bad, Professor. Something wrong?
ERNIE'S VOICE
(lying because he can)
Me? Sweating? Hyperhidrosis. It's a childhood
condition. I was living in Guam at the time, contracted
yellow fever. The. aftereffects are vicious, as you can
imagine, heavy sweating's one of the socially
inconvenient DENNIS'S VOICE
(hoping to distract)
Everything's in order. I've got a plane to catch, so if we
can finish up...
KING'S VOICE
Sit down, Ernie. Take a deep breath.
RENAULT'S VOICE
(boring in on Niles)
A man needs to learn the art of relaxation. Life is a
precious commodity. Why waste it running headlong
into the future? Pause. Enjoy each moment as it passes.
Treadmills are for lab rats.
ERNIE'S VOICE
(a babbled plea)
I don't sweat like this all the time. I was in Korea, we
were just a bunch of fresh-faced kids ...
Suddenly: a crackling BUZZ, static emanating from the wire. Ernie's sweat has caused a short.
Chaos follows, sounds of panic, footsteps shuffling, Ernie's muffled pleas.

COOPER
(instantly alert)
They're in trouble.
Suddenly: the wire goes dead. Not a sound to be heard. Truman reaches for his headset, as if
to adjust. Hawk runs into view.
HAWK
The wire's dead.
Cooper turns back to his binoculars, gazes at the farmhouse below.
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
Nothing at first. Perhaps some tumult glimpsed through a window. Then, suddenly, the front
door bursts open - it's Jean Renault, pushing Dennis Bryson into view, holding him tight,
pressing a gun into his ear. As hostage. Renault bellows:
COOPER!!!

RENAULT

FADE TO BLACK.

END ACT THREE






ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 EXT. DEAD DOG FARM - DAY
Renault presses the gun hard against Bryson's ear. He yells a second time.
RENAULT

COOPER!!
Cooper and Truman exchange a look. A beat. And Cooper steps forward, out of hiding.
Coop!

TRUMAN

COOPER
He came for me, Harry.
Cooper steps from the bluff toward Jean Renault. Truman turns to Hawk.
TRUMAN
(the man of action)
Get Capability on the radio. I want backup.
State police?

HAWK

TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys.
Hawk races back to the cruiser. Below, Cooper nears the farmhouse and Renault.
RENAULT
I want safe passage to the border.
COOPER
I'm not authorized to deal.
RENAULT
Then bring me someone who is.
COOPER
First, release your hostages.
Why?

RENAULT

COOPER
(matter of fact)
We will kill you if you don't.
RENAULT
(re the hostages, etc.)
Then everybody dies.







 
COOPER
That is unacceptable.
RENAULT
We are at cross-purposes, Agent Cooper.
COOPER
(after a beat, new idea)
No. We will trade.
Trade?

RENAULT

COOPER
Your hostages. Ernie Niles and Agent Bryson. For me.
Renault figures. It's what he wanted after all. Finally ... Renault smiles, nods assent.
RENAULT

Agreed.
(loosening his grip on Bryson)
Hands in the air, Agent Cooper. Come to me.
HIGH ANGLE
Cooper raises his hands, takes lonely steps toward Jean Renault, the farmhouse. Renault
releases Bryson. Shoves Ernie Niles after.
 INT. MARSH GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

CUT TO:

A dark bedroom. Moonlight pours through an open window, finds James sleeping. Evelyn
Marsh at his side. Evelyn slips quietly out of bed, naked, dresses in the shadows. CAMERA
FOLLOWS Evelyn as she exits from the bedroom, steps quietly down a flight of stairs.
CAMERA REVEALS Malcom standing below, waiting for her. Evelyn smiles sleepily
Malcom returns a grin.
MALCOM
How's our baby boy?
EVELYN
Sound asleep. Dreaming of love.
MALCOM
Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Malcom opens his arms. Evelyn eases into them. They exchange a deep and lasting kiss.
HOLD ON Malcom and Evelyn for a beat. Embracing in the dark.
CUT TO:





 EXT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT
The farmhouse illuminated by police jeep headlights. Truman, Hawk, other deputies on the
perimeter. All eyes on the silent farmhouse.
 INT. DEAD DOG FARM - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Cooper and Renault sit opposite each other inside. Renault keeps his pistol trained on Cooper.
Preston King paces about, nervous, he peers out a window.
KING
More deputies. Sharpshooters. Let's deal. Or let's run.
King is starting to panic. But not Renault. He remains calm, quietly philosophical.
RENAULT
Will they let us run, Agent Cooper?
No.

COOPER

RENAULT
Will they deal?
I doubt it.

COOPER

RENAULT
(with a sigh)
What do you suggest we do?
Surrender.
I agree.

COOPER
RENAULT

KING
Are you crazy?
RENAULT
(waving him off with the gun)
There is only one thing left to decide. To surrender
quietly. Or to kill you first.
COOPER
Then you will die.



 
I know.




RENAULT

COOPER
Is my death so important?
RENAULT
My brothers are dead. I hold you responsible.
COOPER
(stating the facts, not a plea)
I met Bernard once. As for Jacques, I arrested him,
nothing more.
RENAULT
But I blame you, Agent Cooper.
Why?

COOPER

RENAULT
Before you came here, Twin Peaks was a simple place.
My brothers sold drugs to truck-drivers and teenagers.
One-Eyed Jack's welcomed curious tourists and
businessmen. Quiet people lived quiet lives. Then a
pretty girl dies. And you arrive. Everything changes.
My brother Bernard is shot and left to die in the woods.
A grieving father smothers my surviving brother with a
pillow. Arson, kidnapping. More death and
destruction. Suddenly the quiet people here are no
longer quiet. Their simple dreams have become a
nightmare.
(shifts his grip on the pistol, as if he now meant
to shoot a hole in Cooper's chest)
What's one more death, after all? Maybe yours will be
the last. Maybe you brought the nightmare with you.
Renault is toying with Cooper, spinning words into ideas. But there is something eerily
accurate about his playful philosophizing. King is unimpressed.
KING
I don't know what the hell you think you're talkin' about.
But I do know that we have a goddam problem and if
you don't want to solve it. I will (stops at the window, stares outside. Openmouthed)
Jean? You want to take a look at this?
Renault gets up, steps to the window. Keeping an eye on Cooper all the while. He joins King,
peers outside.
INTERCUT:






 WHAT THEY SEE

Improbably, impossibly, a WAITRESS from the Double R Diner sashays toward the
farmhouse, holding a tray aloft into the night air. It's a surreal image, the waitress caught in
the glaring jeep lights, stepping closer, steam rising off the food above her.
 BACK TO SCENE
KING
(looking out the window)
You order food?
King draws his gun as if to fire. But Renault stops him.
RENAULT
Let her come.
Cooper follows their exchange intently, looks toward the door. A beat. And someone knocks
three times. Renault steps to open it. Standing in the doorway, tray held aloft, is Dennis - or
rather Denise Bryson, in full Double R regalia.
Suppertime.

DENISE

Several things happen simultaneously; Jean looks closer at the waitress, dimly recognizes the
face. Denise lets the tray drop down to her waist, revealing a gun upon it. In one smooth
motion she hurls the pistol toward Cooper, even as he leaps forward out of his chair. Jean turns
to fire at Cooper. Denise drops Preston King with a right cross to the jaw.
Cooper shoots Renault through the heart. Sheriff Truman and Deputy Hawk pour inside, guns
ready. Both spot Renault dead on the floor. Denise cuffing Preston King. They lower their
weapons. A beat, then:
COOPER
Quick thinking, Denise.
DENISE
Don't thank me. Thank Sheriff Truman. It was his idea.
Cooper turns to Harry. Surprised, proud. He smiles.
COOPER
Harry S. Truman.
TRUMAN
(modestly)
I improvised.
HOLD ON them for a beat.

 INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Shelly sleeps curled up on the living room sofa. Still waiting for Bobby to come home. A
record plays on a stereo turntable nearby. Something soft and sweet. Then, suddenly, the
house lights FLICKER, the record begins to slow. The sweet tune distorts eerily. Shelly
wakes with a start.
SHELLY
(sleepy)
Bobby?
The lights FLICKER with greater intensity, now blacking out for seconds at a time. Shelly
slips off the sofa, steps toward the kitchen. Now afraid.
SHELLY
(whispered, hoping)
Bobby, is that you? This isn't funny.
Shelly comes upon Leo's bed revealed in the flickering light. She gasps. The bed is empty.
SHELLY
(her fear increases)
Bobby?
Shelly pivots, looks toward Leo's wheelchair. The wheelchair is empty.
Bobby!!

SHELLY

Shelly whirls about, hysterical. That's when she SEES him. Leo Johnson standing across the
room, swathed in shadow and light. Shelly SCREAMS. And the lights cease their flickering,
the house is plunged into absolute darkness.
 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

OPEN ON the station interior. Pitch black, no lights anywhere. A beat. And LUCY
MORAN leads Cooper, Truman, and Hawk inside. Truman holds a flashlight toward the
dark, pauses to listen to Lucy. Cooper continues ahead.
LUCY
The voice on the phone said there was a bomb planted in
the woods but it didn't say which woods and then all of a
sudden there was this big BANG and the lights went out
and I couldn't find a candle so I called the fire
department.



 




TRUMAN
Was there a fire?
LUCY
Two of them. First there was one at the power station.
But most of the volunteer fire department was playing
bingo so it took a while to get everybody together.
Then there was the bang I told you about. It sounded
like it was right upstairs so we all got out of here.
Well, it turned out to be the transformer on the pole
right above and behind the building but we had to wait
to go back inside because the transformer was shooting
sparks everywhere and we were afraid it would start the
station on fire, too. But it didn't.
TRUMAN
Do they know what started it, Lucy?
LUCY
"Suspicious in nature," that's what Chief Kipple said. He was suffering
from smoke inhalation at the time so he sounded a little hoarse -

Suddenly Cooper's voice is heard in the dark.
COOPER'S VOICE
Harry!
Truman looks up, notices that Cooper and Hawk have proceeded ahead.
Yeah, Coop?

TRUMAN

COOPER'S VOICE
(grave)
You'd better take a look at this.
TRUMAN
(to Lucy)
Stay here.
Truman steps toward Cooper's voice. CAMERA FOLLOWS Truman, the flashlight's beam,
as he enters the office.
TRUMAN
Cooper?
Truman stops still. The flashlight's beam tracks across the office floor, REVEALS Cooper and
Hawk standing by Harry's desk, eyes turned toward his chair. Truman shifts, aims the flashlight
to follow their gaze ...
... and reveals a horrifying tableau. A DEAD MAN seated in the chair, eyes frozen wide in an
agonizing stare, mouth taped shut as if to silence screams. Before him, arrayed atop the desk, a
chess board. The dead man's hand has been set upon a knight, as if to make his next move.







 (2)
TRUMAN
My God. Who is it?
COOPER
(with great sadness, a little fear)
I don't know.
But why?

TRUMAN

COOPER
(turning to Truman, the light)
It's a game of chess, Harry. This is Windom Earle's next
move.
HOLD ON Cooper for a beat.
FADE TO BLACK.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:


INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Close on the fibers of a fabric tape. We slowly pull back revealing that it is the tape covering
the mouth of the DEAD MAN. A surgical gloved hand reaches into the frame and slowly
pulls the tape off the mouth, inside the mouth attached to the tape is a black chess piece - a
pawn. We pull back to DOC HAYWARD, AGENT COOPER.
Good Lord.

HAYWARD

Cooper reaches in, removes the chess piece and examines it: it's a match to the pieces on the
chess board set up on the table. HARRY enters the room.
TRUMAN
No one saw a thing. The blackout and fire drew
everyone out of the building.
COOPER
Andy, we'll need this dusted for prints ...
Cooper drops the chess piece in a bag and hands it to ANDY standing inside the door with his
eyes closed so he won't see the body and cry. He reaches out for the bag, misses it. Truman
puts it in Andy's hand. Andy turns to leave and walks into to the wall with a thud. Andy peeks,
adjusts his trajectory and makes it.
TRUMAN
How long has he been dead, Doc?
HAYWARD
Hard to tell; we'll need an autopsy.
COOPER
Doc, open the victim's shirt. I believe you will find an
incision, a stab wound one inch beneath the sternum,
penetrating upwards, severing the aorta.
Hayward and Truman exchange a look then Doc opens the shirt. Cooper was right.
TRUMAN
You've seen this before.
COOPER
(nods, examines the floor)
No blood stains.

Cooper picks a pine needle up off the floor. Then walks to the middle windowsill, examines
with magnifier. HAWK comes in the door.
COOPER
Hawk, footprints?
HAWK
Two sets, same boots; one coming, one leaving. Heavier
impressions on the way down.
COOPER
Carrying the body.
TRUMAN
We should get molds made of those before it rains.
COOPER
He'll have been wearing the wrong size shoe, untraceable
and already destroyed.
HAWK
I followed them to the granite stream up the ridge, lost
them on the rocks.
COOPER
He knows how to mask a trail ... any cars stolen in town
recently?
TRUMAN
There was one a couple of days ago, from the Cash and
Carry on Sparkwood. No witnesses. Cooper, you're
sure Windom Earle's behind this?
Cooper nods, steps to the window, looks into the darkness.
COOPER
A short time ago, a vagrant ... our victim was befriended
and offered a lift. He was given some cheap wine and a
cigarette. The victim was then driven to a location up
behind the ridge, you'll find the car still up there. He
was stabbed, once, managed to run at least fifty yards,
cutting his hands and face on brush before collapsing.
Earle engineered the explosion that caused the power
failure, created the diversionary fire that drew everyone
outside the station, then brought the body in through this
window.
(turns, Faces them)
Windom Earle has been in this room. I can still feel his
presence. There aren't going to be any fingerprints in

COOPER 
here, Harry. No slip-ups, oversights, no mistakes.
Everything he does has its own rationale, precision and
intelligence. Windom Earle is a genius. And he's taken
his first pawn. In a very sick game.

INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
AUDREY and BOBBY sit at a small round table. The power is out. Candlelight illuminates
the scene. They have drinks between them. Plus a bucket of ice. Audrey drops a few cubes
into Bobby's glass and a few into hers.
AUDREY
Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs, here's what we're gonna
do. If I have learned anything from my father before he
flipped his wig it's that a business relationship is a
sacred pact, equaled only by the closest of personal
relationships ... where nothing is held back.
Right.

BOBBY

AUDREY
Do you want to get rich, Bobby?
BOBBY
Immediately.
AUDREY
Maybe I can help. This is the last of the ice cubes till the
power comes back on.
She reaches over and picks an ice cube out of Bobby's drink.
AUDREY
Now, pretend this is my father.
She closes her hand around it.
An ice cube?

BOBBY

AUDREY
Right. And our job now is to help my father find his
way back from Limbo-Land so he doesn't melt away and
leave me with a handful of nothing.
She reopens her hand, the cube is melted.
AUDREY
We wouldn't want that to happen, would we?
BOBBY

No.

AUDREY
From now on Bobby I'm the one you suck up to.
She licks up the melted water.

POV, moving frantically through the darkened kitchen into the living room and to the door.
We pull back, SHELLY desperately tries to open the door but it's been locked from the out
side.

No!

SHELLY
(screaming)

She looks back into the kitchen, it's pitch black, she can't see a thing.

SHELLY
(pleading)
Oh, God ... please no.
The sound of a creaking wheel on the wheelchair is heard.
Leo?

SHELLY

Out of the darkness comes Leo's wheelchair directly toward her, it knocks over a lamp, comes
closer and closer. She jumps out of the way as it crashes into the door. Shelly starts for a
window, something flies through the air and lands at her feet. She freezes; a bar of soap in a
sock lays on the floor. A guttural laugh rises out of the darkness.
SHELLY
Don't do this, Leo.
From the darkness comes.
LEO
(slurred, and bursting with pride that he's e's back)
Le...O. Le...O.
The refrigerator door swings open. The light from inside illuminates a grinning crazedlooking LEO.
LEO
F-u-n-s o-v-e-r.
Leo laughs again. The refrigerator slowly closes. From the darkness comes the sound of a foot
dragging across the floor. Shelly makes a break for it, out of the darkness Leo's hand grabs
Shelly by the neck, pulls her close to him.
Le-o go-od.

LEO

He smiles, then throws her across the table, sending her and everything on the table crashing
into the corner.
Fu-n.

LEO

Leo shuffles toward Shelly, his left leg and arm not quite up to snuff. He stops, reaches up and
turns on the radio.
LEO
Le-o like mu-sic.

Shelly picks up a toaster and hurls it at him, bouncing it off his chest. Leo looks at the
toaster, then down at his chest.
Ow.

LEO

Shelly tries to run again, no luck, Leo has her, grabs her by the throat. He starts to spin her
around, his grip tightening on her throat as he does. Shelly tries to pull away, but even with
only one good arm Leo it too much, desperately close to passing out she strikes, gouging at his
eyes. Leo erupts in a rage, throws her into the living room where she crashes against the wall.
Leo then flips the kitchen table over and lets out an animal like howl.


EXT. LEO'S BACK DOOR - NIGHT

Bobby steps up to the door, still buzzed from the evening with Audrey, takes in a deep breath
of the fresh night air, and hears Leo's howl.

Bobby tries the door but it won't open, then bangs on it.

Bobby walks over to the window and looks in, rubs on the glass to get a clearer view. Shelly
pulls herself up to the glass, bruised and crying.
BOBBY
(immediate concern)
Shelly?
We hear the howl again, then Leo's fist comes crashing through the window. Bobby tumbles
away from the window in terror.

Leo?

BOBBY

From inside we hear Shelly scream, as Leo grabs her.

Bobby races to the door and tries to break it in, no luck.

INT. LEO'S - NIGHT

Leo has Shelly by the hair and is dragging her toward the living room. Off screen we can hear
the frantic pounding and shouts of Bobby. They reach the kitchen and Leo drops her onto the
floor. Stands over her for a long moment.
LEO
Good-bye wi-fe.
He raises up his big boot above her face, a tear falls from his eye, he's going to crush her.
Shelly screams. Bobby bursts through the back door and is on Leo before he can react. They
tumble to the floor, for a moment Bobby has an advantage.
You bastard!

BOBBY

Leo suddenly reaches up with tremendous strength, grabs a surprised Bobby by the neck and
flips him on to the floor, then is on top of him. Leo smiles.
LEO
Hell-o Bob-by.
Leo begins to laugh, then tightens his grip. Bobby gags, the throat is beginning to go. Bobby
manages to reach into a pocket and pull out his lighter, flicks it on. Leo stares at the flame,
transfixed. Bobby moves the lighter close to Leo's face. Leo smiles, transfixed. Bobby then
adjusts the flame and it shoots up into Leo's face, he erupts in a scream and covers his face with
his hands.
LEO
(screaming)
Ahhhh!
He stands, bounces off the walls knocking things down, then runs out into the darkness. Bobby
crawls over to Shelly, takes her in his arms, a tear falls from her eyes.
Bobby.

SHELLY

BOBBY
It's okay now, he's gone.

SHELLY
Don't leave me again, please, Bobby, please.

forensic work which is winding up.
TRUMAN
No prints, no fibers. You were right. If it's Earle, he
didn't miss a beat.

Did you hear from Denise, uh, Agent Bryson?
COOPER

The DEA and the Bureau have cleared me of all criminal
charges. But the suspension stands. I'm waiting to hear

TRUMAN
In the meantime you're still my deputy. This case is

Cooper looks at the body as it's carried out.
COOPER
I want it, Harry.
Hawk enters.
HAWK
Found that stolen car on a logging road just as you said
... no prints. And just so you know, Hank Jennings
missed the buy at Dead Dog because he was in the
hospital. Claims he was hit by a bus. I cuffed him to
the bed and booked him for parole violation. One more
thing: Shelly Johnson just called. She says Leo Johnson
came to last night, attacked her and ran off into the

Harry and Cooper react. Another flashbulb goes off.

The stretcher with the body is slowly wheeled out by TWO ATTENDANTS. One of the

He's nine years old.

See how you feel when you drive it.
JEFFREY
I'm sure it will be fine. Sounds like it's lucky we found

James can't place this pleasant man with the one who beats his wife. He feels like hell.

Lucky for me too.

JAMES
Yeah. Will be again soon, I guess.
JEFFREY
No itinerary, no deadlines ... I'm envious. Wish I was

puffs on a cigar as he sights a small cannon. On the floor of the office are toy soldiers in
marching columns and an elaborate train set. DOCTOR JACOBY sits across the battle field,
pencil and note pad in hand. The office doors swing open, Audrey enters with JERRY.

JACOBY
He prefers General.
AUDREY
He's marching on Washington. We think he's getting

AUDREY
He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart.
JACOBY

You're with the cavalry.
BEN
Jeb, a great day is upon us. By dawn our troops will be
on the outskirts of Washington. By mid-day it will fall,
and we will once again walk on my cherished fields in
Arlington.
(he looks at Jerry very solemnly)
Only God can stop us now. And it is my firm belief,
Jeb, that the almighty is a Southerner.
Ben moves back to his soldiers. Jerry looks at Audrey, then back at his brother, tries to smile.
JERRY
Hallelujah ...
Jerry glances over to Jacoby, motions him over to join Audrey and himself
JERRY
You think it's a good idea for Ben to be carrying a
sword?
JACOBY
Your brother is suffering from delusions brought about
by emotional collapse. He thinks he's on a forced march
to Washington. He's crossing the Maryland border as we
speak.
He's nuts.

JACOBY
Actually what he is doing is quite healthy. By reversing the South's
defeat in the civil war he will in turn reverse his own setbacks. What he
needs now is both your understanding, a confederate victory, and a good
price for his cotton. Metaphorically speaking.

Jacoby smiles. Jerry looks over at Ben.

Close on the chess board set found with the body. We slowly circle it, coming to Cooper,
intently staring at it. Coffee cup in hand. Harry joins him.
TRUMAN
How does chess figure into all this?
Cooper studies the board for a moment, then looks at Harry.
COOPER
Because we played a game every day for three years. Windom felt all
of life could be found in the patterns and conflicts created on the board.
And because I never beat him, and we both know it. Now I have to
make my next move. I'll publish it in the Twin Peaks Chronicle
tomorrow. That should do it. He's close.
TRUMAN
Coop, I think I need some more information here.
COOPER
Harry, I've brought some baggage to town with me I haven't told
you about.
TRUMAN

Well, as your superior Cooper turns to Harry. The coffee cup shakes in his hand. Both notice. For the first time
Truman sees fear in Cooper's eyes.
COOPER
Windom Earle was my first partner. Everything I know about the law
and the bureau I owe to him. Four years ago we drew the assignment of
protecting a material witness in a federal crime. She was a very gentle,
very beautiful woman. Her name was Caroline. She and I ... fell in love.

TRUMAN
What happened?
COOPER
One night, I failed in my vigilance. An attack was
made. I was wounded, stabbed, lost consciousness.
When I awoke, Caroline was in my arms. She was dead.
She had also been stabbed.
TRUMAN
(putting it together)
The wounds on the vagrant?
COOPER
Identical. The killer was never caught. My wounds
healed. Windom Earle ... went mad. Institutionalized,
until his recent escape.
TRUMAN
So why is he after you now?
COOPER
(a beat)
Harry, Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.
Harry takes a seat.
TRUMAN
So he blames you for her death.
COOPER
No. It's worse than that - much worse. I think he killed
her. And I think he also committed the murder that she
originally witnessed. He used to beat her, Harry, that's
what I found out when I ...
(can't continue for a moment)
Windom's mind is ... like a diamond. It's cold and
hard and brilliant and at some point he stopped caring
about right and wrong. I also believe Windom feigned
the insanity that sent him away. You don't know what
he's capable of. You don't know.

school nights.
(Ed smiles, Doc rises)
Ed, Donna took the van this morning, said something
about going to look for James. Is there anything I need
to be worried about?
BIG ED
He's out west a couple of hours, just trying to clear his head,
I think. Donna's taking him some money.
DOC
It's not easy being a parent is it?
It sure ain't.

BIG ED

Doc leaves, Norma walks over with a piece of pie. Slides in across from Ed.
NORMA
Hank's in the hospital. He says a tree fell on him.
(she reaches out and touches a bruise on his face)
Doesn't have anything to do with this, does it?
BIG ED
The tree was a redwood named Nadine.
(Norma doesn't quite get it)
Honey, after you left yesterday, Hank jumped me, right
in my own living room. The truth is, if Nadine hadn't
walked in when she did, it'd be me in the hospital or
someplace worse.
NORMA
Nadine took out Hank?
BIG ED
Yep. And it wasn't pretty.

Norma sits back, they study each other.
NORMA
Harry called, they're arresting Hank for a parole
violation. When he's well, he could be going back to
prison. I think it's time I start correcting a few of the
mistakes I've made.
He reaches out, takes her hand.
BIG ED
We could start by getting a cabin, a bottle of sparkling
wine and some venison steaks.
NORMA
People will find out.
Ed grips her hand.
Let'em.

 INT. SHERIFF STATION - DAY

CLOSE ON the the face of an exhausted MAJOR BRIGGS, standing at the front door, we
pull back. The Major is a wreck, barely makes it to Lucy's desk.

Major Briggs?
BRIGGS

He looks at her, and slowly sinks to the floor.

TRUMAN
BRIGGS

Lucy leaves. Truman and Cooper turn their attention to Briggs.
TRUMAN
Major, what happened?
BRIGGS
As men who have dedicated their lives to service, I know
you are able to understand how sacred I hold a pledge of
allegiance. And the cost one must pay when breaking a
pledge.
COOPER
It can be very great.
BRIGGS
The Air Force, I thought was not unlike other societies
of men, dedicated to the fight for good.
Harry and Cooper look at each other wondering. Briggs gets up from his chair.
BRIGGS
Gentlemen, frankly I'm worried. When my superiors
questioned me about my disappearance they exhibited a
degree of suspicion and intolerance bordering on the
paranoic. I must now admit that their motivation in the
search for the White Lodge is not ideologically pure.
(turns to them)
I believe that during my disappearance I was taken to
the White Lodge. I remember virtually nothing, but I
have the clear intuitive sense that there is much trouble
ahead.
COOPER
What kind of trouble?
BRIGGS
I am not aware of the form it will take.
(straightens himself up, back to form)
I will return. Until that time, I will be in the shadows if
you need me. Good day, gentlemen.

On that note he leaves. Harry and Cooper are left a little dumbstruck.

He leaves, Truman and Cooper follow.

Truman and Cooper enter, join Hawk and Andy. At the other end of the room stand Jacoby
and LANA.
JACOBY
Good, I wanted everyone to hear this. I have just spent
most of the last twenty four hours with this charming
young lady. And as you can see, I have no bruises, no
broken bones. Any claims by her deceased husband's
brother that she is cursed and somehow responsible for a
death is nonsense. What she does possess is a heightened
sexual drive and a working knowledge of technique,
anatomy, and touch, few men have ever had the pleasure
of experiencing, or the skill to match.
Lana blushes, smiles. Looks them all over. Pause.
TRUMAN
Is it warm in here?
Yes.

Cooper steps forward, extends his hand.
COOPER
Lana, let me be the first to congratulate you.
LANA
Thank you. I could never have done it without Dr.
Jacoby.

JACOBY
Okay. Well, then, we're going bowling.
Jacoby and Lana walk out. They all look at each other for a moment. Cooper whistles, as in
"Put your lips together and blow."
Amen.

TRUMAN

A moment later we HEAR a scream.

 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK

Jacoby and Lana are staring down the barrel of a huge shotgun, held by DWAYNE
MILFORD. Truman, Cooper, Hawk and Andy rush into the hall. Their guns drawn.

The gun swings back to Lana and Jacoby.
DWAYNE
And the hippie too.
We pull back.
TRUMAN
Mr. Mayor, this is not going to solve anything.
DWAYNE
She killed my brother!
JACOBY
Mr. Mayor, Lana has killed no one.
DWAYNE
Horse dung. Come over here, Lana. Come over here.
No one moves. Cooper steps up.
COOPER
Fellas, why don't we let the Mayor and Lana talk this
over alone.
DWAYNE
I don't want to talk, I want to shoot.
COOPER
You can always shoot later, Dwayne. Talk first.
(he motions into the conference room)
Right in here. Go ahead, Lana, it'll be fine.
Dwayne backs into the conference room with a reluctant Lana and closes the door.
TRUMAN
What do we do now?

Wait.
Wait?

COOPER

Cooper nods. Pause.
TRUMAN
Are you sure?
Nope.

COOPER

They wait; it's not as easy as it sounds. After several silent moments, Jacoby starts to chuckle,
then stops. Several long moments pass. Everyone is getting fidgety.
ANDY
(whispers)
It's kind of hard ... waiting.
Everyone nods. Several more moments pass. Jacoby chuckles again. More silence, then
Cooper steps over to the door of the conference room and listens.
OK.

COOPER

He motions Hawk to the other door, they all take out their guns, then burst in.
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO:

All guns are trained on Dwayne ... with Lana sitting in his lap in the middle of a deep,
passionate kiss. The guns are all holstered. Dwayne, covered in lipstick, finishes the kiss and
looks up, beaming.
DWAYNE
We've decided to adopt a child.
Lana kisses him again.
LANA
He's so much like Dougie, I feel like my husband's been
brought back to life.
DWAYNE
I've been lonely and selfish. I hope you'll all forgive
my boorish behavior. Come along, dear.

Catherine walks over to the office doors, Pete follows several feet behind. They stand at the
closed doors for a moment.
CATHERINE
Have you asked yourself, Pete, how I survived after the
fire? How I was able to effect my transformation into
Tojamura and marshall the resources I needed to defeat
Ben and win back the mill?
PETE
Now that you mention it ... yeah.
Catherine opens the doors, revealing ANDREW PACKARD. Pete is speechless.

Andrew ... I saw the boat ... you ... you ...
ANDREW

Take all the time you need. Good old Pete.
CATHERINE
As you can surmise, I had Andrew's help.
PETE
So, let me get this straight, you didn't die in the boat
accident.
ANDREW
We didn't tell you, Pete, with apologies beforehand,
because you didn't need to know. And frankly ... we
didn't want you to.

Okay. Well, if you're bringing anybody else back from

No.

PETE

Eckhardt and I were business partners. I knew lumber, he
knew Hong Kong. We made a lot of money, had some
fun ... then I got the better of him in a piece of business
and he tried to stab me in the back ...
Really?

PETE

ANDREW
In a manner of speaking. He's a very dangerous and
powerful opponent.
CATHERINE
He plotted Andrew's death for six years. After he
thought Andrew was dead he came after me.
PETE
Does Josie know you're alive, Andy?
Catherine and Andrew glance at each other. As if talking to a child.
CATHERINE
Pete, dear, Josie worked for Eckhardt.
PETE
That's right. She did? My God ... is she still?
CATHERINE
We'll find out when Eckhardt arrives.

The fax machine begins to beep. Truman steps behind the desk to retrieve the incoming

Lucy walks in with Doc Hayward and DICK TREMAYNE. Everyone stops, sizes up the
situation. A stern Doc zeros in on Andy.
HAYWARD
Andy, in here, we're going to talk.
Andy dutifully follows Doc into Truman's office. Truman studies the fax. Troubled.

Close on Andy and Dick seated next to each other. Doc stands above them, his arms folded
across his chest. Lucy vigorously paces the room.
HAYWARD
When Lucy told me about your "theory" I called the
orphanage and cut through the red tape. I immediately
got to the bottom of things because I was there when it
all begin. Little Nicky is no more a murderer than
Lucy or I.
TREMAYNE
I believe pathological was the phrase we used, Doc HAYWARD
Dick, I didn't drop you on your head when I brought you
into this world, don't give me cause to regret that.
ANDY
Doc, it's just HAYWARD
Shut up and listen, the both of you.
Lucy smacks a bug with a flyswatter like it's a baseball.
HAYWARD
Little Nicky entered this world through the back door
where hope and promise never saw the light. His mother
was a poor immigrant chambermaid at the Great
Northern. Nicky was conceived during an assault by a
man in a back alley who fled across the border. She
never reported it to the police, but when she started to
show she reported it to me. But Nicky's mother had a
dream for a better life, for herself and her child. It was
the dream that brought her to this country. She decided
to carry that child. The poor wretch never saw the boy.
She died just as Nicky took his first breath. I delivered
that woman's baby. We buried her in Potter's Field and
sent the infant to the orphanage. For several years he was
shuttled from one state home to another. Then one day,
hope finally shined on little Nicky. A young childless
couple brought him into their lives. They were loving,
caring parents. It all collapsed in one terrible moment
on an icy highway. There was a crash. Six year old
Nicky managed to pull both his parents from the
burning wreck, but it was too late, and Nicky was alone
once again, as he is today.

I'm being framed
DONNA
It doesn't make any difference. We can't just wait for
cops to catch us. I think you should call Big Ed.
JAMES
No, my only chance is to talk to Evelyn. If she told me
this was a set up, maybe she'll tell the police, too.

You wouldn't have a chance. The police will be waiting
for you. We've got to keep moving.
JAMES
But she'd listen to me. I know she would.

car and there was an accident - James thinks The COP from the Marsh House enters the bar. Donna stares at the cop and then at James who
also watches the cop. James slides out of the bar. Donna is about to run after him when the
Cop moves suspiciously towards her. She changes the subject.
DONNA

really cure, isn't he? He lettered in football? What

Bobby, where were you the night the mill burned?
BOBBY
What's that got to do with this?
TRUMAN
Leo tried to kill you. Maybe you shot him that night.
BOBBY
No way. I went to Shelly's house the night of the fire
because I was worried about her. Leo was waiting for

Jennings shot him through the window.
TRUMAN
You sure it was Hank?
Absolutely.

(shouts like Cole)
"I'M WORRIED ABOUT COOP.
(spreads out a map, pointing out a pattern
marked on it)
Biloxi, Houston, Oklahoma City, Salina, Lincoln,
Chicago. Earle's been sending gift wrapped packages to
police departments and offices of major law
enforcement agencies. Each look like mail bombs, but
turn out to be harmless. Deliveries are paid for with
phony credit cards signed "Windom Earle." Cole's
doing the follow up on this. He should run up here after
that.

ALBERT
He's got the DEA, FBI, Treasury, Postal Service and
the Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Illinois state patrols
looking for him. Invited all of them to the party, but
my guess is he won't dance with anyone but you, Coop.

Cooper is unnerved. Albert retrieves more work from his case.
ALBERT
The vagrant in the office died from a knife wound
severing the aorta. He'd been dead for two days.
TRUMAN
But it's finger was pointing to the chess board? How did
he manage that with the rigamortis?
ALBERT
Rigamortis goes from head to toe but after two days
leaves the body toe to head. Earle waited for it to leave
the arms and fingers so that he could maneuver them on
the chess board.
(moving on)
And then he played Zeus at the power station.
COOPER
How do you know?
ALBERT
He left us this map. Taped under a table.

Cooper moves away from the map. Stares our the window. Albert worries for his friend.
ALBERT

He's making his move. Most definitely.
Albert moves to the door. Tries to cheer Cooper up.
ALBERT 
About the uniform, Coop. Replacing the elegance of the
dark suit and tie with the casual indifference of a mouse
brown work outfit is a form of fashion suicide, but, call
me crazy, I like it.
Albert goes out. Truman studies the frightened Cooper.

INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
LEO JOHNSON in bed with his wounds from the night before freshly dressed. WINDOM
EARLE sits next to him playing an antique wooden flute. Five stainless steel square suitcases
rest near him. The chess board is set up on the table. A small school desk sits by the door.
On one wall is a Earle's high tech command module - computer, modem, monitoring
devices, police scanners. Leo awakes to the haunting flute music.
EARLE
Ah, you are awake, then.
(stands over him)
I trust you've slept well.
(goes to his computer returns with Leo's picture
and a police APB)
While you slept I've learned all about you.

"Leo Johnson."
(takes out Leo's sheet)
The police would like to see you as soon as possible.











EARLE 
"Drug trafficking, arson, attempted murder."
(studies the next item)
"Domestic violence." I'm partial to that.
Leo tries to make a bolt for the door. Earle slams his wound with his flute. Leo falls back.
EARLE
Well, Leo, I have cleansed your wounds. You're on the
mend. I've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw.
(tasting this)
Leo. Leo the Lion.
(plays a trill on the flute)
I want you to help me. And obey me. Will you do
that?
Leo hesitates. Earle shows the flute to Leo.
EARLE
In thirteenth century Japan the Samurai were stripped of
their weaponry. But they discovered that the aged and
treated bamboo of their Shaku hachi flute made an
excellent cudgel.
(smacks Leo again, then walks back to the table)
This flute is truly an instrument of pleasure, don't you
think?
Leo tries to make a run for it, but merely allows Earle to have more fun with his flute. It ends
with Earle standing over Leo near the doorway. He takes a dog collar out of his coat.
EARLE
I wanted to save this necklace for an "occasion," but now
you've ruined it.
He wraps the collar around Leo's neck. Attached is a round object that looks like a beer can.
EARLE
Now, come over here. I've made you some gruel.
As Earle returns to the table, Leo scrambles for the door. He stops short. Struggling with an
electrical shock coming from the collar. He falls backwards. Stunned. Earle sits at his table.
EARLE
Come here, Leo. Come on.
Leo struggles towards the table as Earle plays his flute.

Almost twenty years, Norma. One day we're talking

NORMA
I tried not to think about it. Spent more and more time

was nothing else. We were open everyday so that I
wouldn't have another life. No birthdays, no Fourth of

thinking about presents I never got to buy you. Never got
to give you.

I bought you a present last Christmas. An onyx and
turquoise bolo tie. I walked over to your house to give it

It's about the future now, Ed, and what we are going to
do about it.
(kisses him)
I want you to pick me up after I close the diner, tonight,
and I want you to take me home.
ED
You're right, it's all ahead of us.
They kiss again.
NORMA
Plenty of time.









Ed rolls on top of Norma with a kiss. As Norma responds they are interrupted by a crash
from the next room.
NADINE'S VOICE
Eddie ... Eddie? ...
Norma scrambles to get her clothes on, but Ed stops her.
ED
Don't Norma. I may as well talk to her now.
Before they can get up, NADINE HURLEY walks into the room. She sits dejectedly on the
bed. She carries a trophy.
ED
Hello, Nadine.
NADINE
Got all the way to the District Finals at Knife River
only to find out the airplane slam is illegal. I was
disqualified.
(holds up the trophy)
Second Place. What a drag.
ED
(scrambling)
That's a tough break, alright.
Nadine stares at Norma for a moment.
NORMA
Hello, Nadine.
NADINE
I owe you an apology, Norma. I mean I really pounded
Hank and I am sorry. But I thought he was going to do
something to Eddie and I sort of got mad.
Thank you.

NORMA

Nadine gets up and walks to the door. Turns back.
NADINE
Know what?
(sad but honest)
I know about you guys. And it's really, really okay.
Cause now, I don't feel so guilty about me and Mike.








ED
You and Mike.
NADINE
I don't want to get into it, but I have to tell you, it is
really, really serious.
(another look at them)
So you two should do whatever you want. I am
completely cool about all of this. Really.
Nadine slowly exits leaving a baffled Norma and Ed.



INT. BLUE PINE LODGE OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

Truman and Cooper sit across a table from JOSIE PACKARD who is in her maid's outfit.
The newspaper clipping with Jonathan's picture lies between them.
TRUMAN
Josie, this is it. I have to tell the police in Seattle
something. They asked me to question you. They know
you're connected with Jonathan.
JOSIE
How did he die? Was it a robbery?
COOPER
(pressing the point)
He was shot three times in the back of the head.
Josie begins to cry. Uneasy, Cooper checks his coffee cup
COOPER
I think I'll get another cup of joe.
Cooper walks to the kitchen area. Truman presses Josie.
TRUMAN
If you were ever going to tell the truth, Josie, this would
be an ideal time.
Josie trembles with fear.


INT. BLUE PINE LODGE, KITCHEN AREA - DAY

CUT TO:

Cooper pours himself a cup of coffee. PETE MARTELL struggles in the door with a huge
load of DRY CLEANING.







Cooper.
Hello, Pete.




PETE
COOPER

PETE
(perturbed)
I get over to the "Clean and Save" and Jeanie Pombelek was working
the counter. She doesn't speak a word of English. Nada. Zip. She's
from Budapest. We just stood there and looked at each other like we
were made of wood.
Something in the laundry catches Cooper's eye.
COOPER
Who does all this belong to?
PETE
(confidential)
Catherine's runnin' her into the ground so I offered to stop by
the dry cleaner and pick up Josie's stuff.
(back to his problem)
The only words I know in Hungarian are paprika and goulash.
It took me twenty minutes to get this stuff.
Cooper takes a COAT out of the dry cleaning.
COOPER
This is Josie's?
PETE

Yep.
The phone rings. Pete answers it.

PETE
Hello ... Just a minute.
(to Cooper)
It's for Josie, she here?
COOPER
In the other room.
Pete moves into the next room.
PETE'S VOICE
Josie, it's for you.
Cooper moves quickly to the coat and taking out his pocket knife cuts away a small piece of
fabric from the Vicuna coat. He then opens the coat and there are a pair of gloves pinned to
the hanger. He takes the gloves.
CUT TO:










BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM
With Truman and Pete in the background Josie answers the phone.
Hello.

JOSIE

INTERCUT:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL, THOMAS ECKHARDT'S ROOM - DAY
ECKHARDT has placed the call to Josie.
ECKHARDT
Josie, it's Thomas. I'm so glad I've found you. I'm
wondering if we can get together.
Terrified, Josie stands frozen with the phone in her hand.
ECKHARDT
Did you hear about what's happened to Jonathan?
Dreadful. Dreadful.
 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - ANOTHER PHONE IN THE HOUSE

CUT TO:

CATHERINE listens on an extension. She hangs up the phone.
CATHERINE
Welcome to Twin Peaks, Mr. Eckhardt.
 ECKHARDT'S ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

Eckhardt hangs up the phone. JONES stands behind him.
ECKHARDT
She's run back to Catherine Martell. I am disappointed.
(in Afrikaans)
She's become predictable.
JONES
(in Afrikaans)
I warned you not to trust her.
Jones returns to some suitcases on the bed and her unpacking. There are maps, blue prints,
pictures of Catherine, Josie in her maid's outfit, and Pete. A hand gun, high tech photography
equipment, a high powered rifle waiting to be assembled and a parabolic microphone.
CUT TO:






 INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
BEN HORNE talks to a stunned group of HOTEL STAFF. He sits on a saddle draped over
a STUFFED HORSE. Young JOHNNY HORNE stands nearby, arms folded, Indian
headdress on, mind blank and jumbled. DR. JACOBY stands to one side. Observing.
BEN
So I said to Stonewall Jackson. "What would you like
to do when we run the Yanks up to Canada?" And he says,
"Follow them. I'd like to be the Duke of Montreal."
And I say to Stonewall, "Then we'd have to fight the
French?" And then he just gives me that Stonewall look
of his and says, 'What are we waiting for?"
Ben laughs heartily. Johnny gives a hearty howl. The Hotel staff reacts with ashen silence.
Jacoby walks to the back of the room to confer with a bemused JERRY HORNE and a
concerned AUDREY.
AUDREY
What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?
JACOBY
Letting him out to mingle with the public does not seem
to have helped.

AUDREY
We can't just leave him like this.
JERRY
Well, you have to admit he's kind'a fun this way.






15/

 

AUDREY
(turning to Jacoby)
Dr. Jacoby I want you to bring my father back.
JACOBY
To the office?
AUDREY
To the real world.
JACOBY
I think it's time for implementation of the Appomatox
scenario.
All pause to consider this desperate measure. Just then. BOBBY BRIGGS rushes past Ben and
the staff and up to Aubrey. He is dressed as a CONFEDERATE BUGLE BOY.
BOBBY
Sorry, I'm late boss.

HOLD ON this incongrous tableau, as Ben chatters on in the background...

BEN
I asked Stonewall what I should do with Lincoln and he
said, "Honest Abe is going to be about as useful to you
as a spittoon cleaner in a whorehouse."
(a beat)
Ah, but Stonewall is gone from me now. His life cut
short by a cruel hail of Yankee lead. He died alone.
Without my comfort.

CUT TO:






 INT. WALLY'S BAR - DAY
Evelyn Marsh wobbles back from the juke box. Sits at the bar and dumps down another
martini. Donna, who's been waiting near the back, approaches her.
Mrs. Marsh?

DONNA

Evelyn stares at her through a haze.
DONNA
I'm Donna Hayward. James' friend.
EVELYN
I remember you.
(to the barkeeper)
Get the lady here a drink with an umbrella in it.
(looks at Donna, pats the stool next to her)
It's alright, dear, sit down.
DONNA
(diving in)
Why are you doing this to James?







 
Why not?

EVELYN

DONNA
Don't you realize how good he is?
EVELYN
He was good at two things. The car and me. He's a lot
of fun. But then, I hope you already know that.
DONNA
(almost shouting)
You don't get it do you? I'm talking about our lives.
EVELYN
Life will be rosy if you can just get out of one silly little
jam. Maybe. Maybe not.
(takes another drink)
Talk to me in a couple of years when you're whole life
has turned to crap. Cause that's what happens, you know.
Life turns to crap.
DONNA
Because you've made a mess of your life we have to pay.
EVELYN
Are you looking for that pure heart that beats within the
evil vixen? Dial on. He's going over.
DONNA
You make everything sound so pointless and stupid.
EVELYN
(takes another drink)
If there was a reason to climb out of the primeval swill,
believe me, dear, I'd know it.
DONNA
Would you? Really?
Before they can go any further Malcolm appears behind them. Moves to Evelyn quickly, but
quietly.
MALCOLM
Here you are.
Takes her strongly by the hand.






 
MALCOLM
Get in the car.
Evelyn obediently weaves towards the door. Malcolm turns to Donna. Takes her firmly by
her shoulders and whispers.
MALCOLM
There is nothing you can do for your friend, honey. So
trundle back to your little town safe in the knowledge
that if you come here again, I will kill you.
Malcolm goes to the door.
DONNA
(shouting)
Don't do this to him. Please.
Donna watches them go out.

ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 EXT. SHERIFFS STATION - DAY
Re-establish.
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

Cooper enters the conference room. Agent Rosenfield sits at an overhead projector.
ALBERT
(re first slide)
The vicuna thread sample taken from Josie's coat.
(re second slide)
The traces found on the floor outside your room.
Cooper turns out the lights. Albert is illuminated by the projector's glow. He places two
slides upon the overhead plate. Images cast upon the blackboard wall.
COOPER
(he already knows the answer)
Did they come from the same coat?
INCLUDE INSERT
A microscopic comparision of the two slides.
ALBERT
Let me put it to you this way, Coop. Either Josie
Packard pulled the trigger, or she's loaning her winter
wear to the wrong kind of people.
(looking up at Cooper)
A perfect match.
Cooper sits opposite with a sigh. Considers Josie. And Sheriff Truman.
COOPER
What about the gloves?
ALBERT
Still checking for powder burns. I'll have the results by
morning.
COOPER
Did you look into the Seattle homicide?
Albert produces crime photos from a folder on the tabletop, slides them to Cooper.


 






ALBERT
Locals are looking for a "beautiful Asian Woman", late
twenties in connection with the murder of one Jonathan
Kumaguy. Mr. Kumaguy has an Interpol sheet as long as
your arm...and three holes in the back of his head. I'm
betting the bullets will match the slugs we took out of
your vest.
COOPER
(looking at photos)
Josie. Again.
ALBERT
Coop, as you know, Truman and I have had our
differences in the past. But the big lug's got his heart in
the heart in the right place if nothing else. And I'm not above
feeling a little sympathy for the stalwart and the dull.
COOPER
What's your point?
ALBERT
Speaking frankly...our Sheriff's got a serious problem
with his girlfriend.
COOPER
(rising to exit)
Albert. Not one word until we're certain.

 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

Cooper enters. Sheriff Truman sits at his desk, a fax before him. A chess board has been set
up nearby. Cooper pauses, Albert's information weighs heavily on him.
TRUMAN
(referring to fax)
Our John Doe has a name. Erik Powell. Transient.
Former Merchant Marine by his prints. Other than that...
COOPER
(chilled)
Powell?
TRUMAN
Yeah. Ring a bell?
COOPER
Caroline. Windom Earle's wife. Powell was her
maiden name.








 
TRUMAN
Do you think this Powell is a relative?
COOPER
(stepping to chess board, shaken)
No. Earle's playing a game of chess according to his
own rules. Every move sends a message. The name
Powell tells me he hasn't forgotten a thing that happened
between us. The marine is the first pawn removed from
the board. Murder committed for my benefit.
TRUMAN
(figuring, re board)
So whenever he takes a piece here ...
COOPER
(nodding toward window/outside)
Someone dies out there ...
(turning to gaze at chess board)
I never beat him.
TRUMAN
(after a beat)
Coop, if it's a chess expert you need ... we've got one of
the best right here in in Twin Peaks.
COOPER
I could use the help, Harry. But Earle is a genius.
TRUMAN
(confident)
I'll arrange a demonstration.
DISSOLVE TO:
 INT. THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
START CLOSE on three small chess boards set up on the counter. A pair of hands move
swiftly from one to the next. We HEAR.
PETE'S VOICE
Check ... Mate ... Check...
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals PETE MARTELL wrapping up a trio of speed chess games in
brilliant fashion. He stands across the counter from his three opponents - Cooper, DOC
HAYWARD, and a bespectacled TOAD - moving effortlessly from board to board, a
picture of focus and concentration. Truman looks on with evident satisfaction.







 
Toad mutters, shakes his head. He's the first to lose. Doc Hayward makes a rather timid
move. Pete pounces with a friendly grin.
PETE
Mate ...
(pauses, waits for Cooper)
And mate.
COOPER
Pete, frankly, I'm impressed.
PETE
I owe it all to the immortal Master: Jose Raoul
Capablanca. If there's chessboards in heaven, you'll find
Jose sittin' across from the Lord.
(Pete points at Hayward's board, exclaims)
The Caro-Karin defense. A Classic.
TRUMAN
They don't come any better. Doc?
HAYWARD
(still staring at the board)
The mind reels.
(smiling at Pete)
One of these days...
COOPER
(leaning forward)
Pete, I need your help. I'm playing a chess match of
considerable importance. I can't tell you any more than
that. I want to put the game into a stalemate while
losing the least number of pieces possible. None, if you
can arrange it.
PETE
(after a beat)
Agent Cooper, I'd be honored to serve. Chess being my
bailiwick.
COOPER
Thanks, Pete. Great players are either far or few.
Pete puffs up with pride. He nearly salutes.



 NORMA JENNINGS




Norma cleans the counter, glances at the chess games, SEES, Shelly Johnson step into view.
Hi.

SHELLY

NORMA
(immediate concern)
Shelly. I heard about Leo. Are you okay?
SHELLY
(not so sure)
Sure. Bobby's looking after me, so I guess I'm safe and
everything...
NORMA
I wanted to come right over. But with Hank gone, it's a
madhouse around here.
SHELLY
Well ... do you need any help? I've got plenty of time
now... I'd feel better during the day, you know, if I was
here...
Shelly's asking for her old job back. And Norma knows it.
NORMA
Are you kidding? Things aren't the same without you.
When can you start?
SHELLY
I don't know, I guess I could start ... now.
NORMA
Welcome back, sweetheart.
They hug. A nice beat. Truman interrupts:
TRUMAN
Excuse me, Norma? Can I talk to you for a minute?

Sure.

NORMA
(she knows what this is about)

(to Shelly)
Your apron's in the back.
Shelly beams, steps off Truman and Norma speak privately:
TRUMAN
Hank's nearly well enough to leave the hospital. I
figured you should know.







 
NORMA
What about his parole violations? Harry, this time I
don't want him back.
TRUMAN
I wouldn't worry. Hank's next stop is a jail cell. We're
charging him with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
Add that to breaking parole...it looks like Hank's going
away for a long, long time.

Good.

NORMA
(after a beat)

Pete is HEARD shouting checkmate off-screen. Another speedy triumph.
 EXT. THE BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

Establish. Night falls.
 INT. THE BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

JOSIE PACKARD, in servant's uniform, places the last piece of silver upon a large dinner
table set for two situated at the center of the Blue Pine living room. CATHERINE
MARTELL, dressed to entertain, supervises Josie's lowly chores with relish.
CATHERINE
Josie, please. Give the fork a little room.
(Josie sighs, rearranges)
Put it right there. Perfect. Now you may prepare to
serve.
JOSIE
(eyes on the empty chairs)
Who will be joining you this evening?
That is secret.

CATHERINE

Just then: the DOORBELL rings. Josie reacts with a start.
The door ... ?

CATHERINE

Josie nods, steps to answer it. She opens the door, goes white with fear. THOMAS
ECKHARDT stands before her. He stares at Josie with dark soulless eyes. Catherine chirps
from the rear.





 
CATHERINE
Ahh, Mister Eckhardt. Welcome.

Josie reacts with a trembling panic, uncertain whether to stay or flee. Eckhardt finally turns his
gaze from her, smiles at Catherine as she approaches.
Thank you.

ECKHARDT

CATHERINE
Josie, where are your manners? Help our guest with his
coat.
Eckhardt turns back to Josie. Catherine smiles. HOLD ON Josie as she reaches for Eckhardt's
coat. Trapped by their civility.
 INT. BLUE PINE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO:

START CLOSE on a pair of trembling hands opening a bottle of wine, then setting it upon a
serving tray. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Josie in the kitchen, carrying the tray toward the
living room. Josie steps toward Catherine and Eckhardt seated at the large circular dinner
table. They converse, run forks through salads on fine china.
ECKHARDT
(to Catherine, sardonic throughout)
I must confess I received your invitation with some
surprise.
CATHERINE
Word travels fast in Twin Peaks. It seemed fitting that
I dine with my late brother's business rival. Some wine,
Josie.
Eckhardt listens to Catherine's charter, now looks up at Josie as she steps toward them
ECKHARDT
(an easy charm)
Your brother was not always my rival. We were friends.
Andrew was a witty, intelligent, and charming man.
Plaudits no doubt employed to describe his sister as well.
CATHERINE
(ignoring the compliment)
But your friendship soured.
ECKHARDT
Sadly. Men of business frequently find their personal
lives disrupted by the larger portraits they paint.






 
CATHERINE
(matching his sardonic tone)
You consider yourself an artist?
ECKHARDT
(with humor)
Of a sort. Your brother was as well.
CATHERINE
(cool and careful)
I wonder, Mister Eckhardt. When you had him killed,
was it for art or money? Don't stand there, Josie, pour.

Josie nearly drops her bottle of wine. But Eckhardt betrays no reaction. He simply turns his
gaze from Josie to Catherine. Catherine's playing a dangerous game. Eckhardt will play
along ... for now. Josie pours blood-red wine into crystal glasses with a shaking hand.
ECKHARDT
(a gentle tone)
Call me Thomas. Your brother did.
CATHERINE
Thomas. We'll have the h'or d'ouerves now, Josie.
Josie moves off to fetch them. As the conversation continues:
ECKHARDT
One does not kill for art or money. They are
commodities easily lost, but just as easily gained.
However, one (small smile, moving from general to particular)
- rather, I, would find reason to kill for love.
CATHERINE
Did you love her that much?
Josie returns, offering a tray of canapes. Eckhardt's tone has been cratonic throughout. But now
he pauses. looks at Josie. Takes a small confection from the tray. And speaks quietly:
Yes.

ECKHARDT

Eckhardt pops the canape in his mouth. Josie nearly drops the tray. Catherine speaks evenly, as
if describing a prized possession.
CATHERINE
(finally giving this love a name)
Josie has the most incredible hands. They effect a sort
of porcelain grace. Each finger a thing of beauty.





 
I remember.

ECKHARDT

Eckhardt reaches out to touch Josie's hand. Josie stands up with a start, freezes. Eckhardt never
takes his eyes from her.
CATHERINE
I wonder. What shall we do with her now?
(eyes to Josie, effecting neutrality)
You've come so far to Twin Peaks. It would be a shame
to leave us empty-handed.
It would.

ECKHARDT

CATHERINE
On the other hand, Josie is almost completely
untrustworthy. She'll betray you again. And again.
ECKHARDT
I have managed to find pleasure in even that repetition.

CATHERINE
Of course I'll miss her cheery disposition. We've
become the very best of friends. Two girls chatting over
tea ...
ECKHARDT
Perhaps you should purchase an animal of some kind. A
cat or a dog.
CATHERINE
But if I give her to you. What will you give me in
return?
ECKHARDT
How can one put a value to something so precious.



 (3)




CATHERINE
But you will ... try?

Yes.

Josie?

ECKHARDT
(after a beat)
CATHERINE
(sharply)

Josie stands mute, trapped in this waking nightmare. She can barely manage a whisper:
Yes?

JOSIE

CATHERINE
Thomas and I will have our main course now.
HOLD ON Josie for a beat.
 EXT. MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT
Establish.
 INT. MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

Evelyn Marsh steps through the dark living room. She carries drink and cigarette, sits upon a
large sofa. Evelyn drinks deeply. Blows smoke-rings toward the shadows that ripple across
the ceiling. Just then: a VOICE in the dark.
JAMES' VOICE
Why did you do it?
Evelyn reacts, startled. James steps out of the black.
JAMES
I've been givin' it a lot of thought. And I still don't
understand.
James pauses, pent up, full of anger. Evelyn stands to meet him.
EVELYN
James, you're not safe here. If Malcom finds you...
JAMES
(intense)
For money, is that it? No, wait. I got it: Malcom's a








 
JAMES 
wrong guy and he made you play along, right? I can
believe that. Make me believe it, Evelyn. Tell me a
story. 'Cause I'm all mixed up and I just want to know
why you did this to me.
EVELYN
(reaching for him)
James...
JAMES
(cold with fury)
Don't touch me.
Evelyn pauses. A long beat, then she whispers:
EVELYN
What did you expect? Apology? A hidden heart of
gold?
(simply)
I did it all. Everything. I found you I lured you in.
And I kept you here while Malcom planned a nice, neat
frame.
Why?

JAMES

EVELYN
For the money. Out of fear. Because I wanted to.
Her words chill him. James' anger subsides. He expected excuses, regret. Anything but this.
EVELYN
That's not exactly what you want to hear, is it, James?
The truth hurts. I know.
James stares into her eyes. Evelyn moves closer. The truth hurts her too:
EVELYN
You're good and you're honest. I'm not. But that doesn't
mean there weren't moments when I truly wanted you
here. Not for the money or for Malcom. But for me.
For the good and honest way you taste.
A long beat. And despite everything she's told him, or perhaps, in some odd way, because of
it...James steps toward Evelyn's arms.
JAMES
I wanted you too.








 
They exchange a gentle kiss. A beat. Footsteps behind them, a sudden leap ... AND
MALCOLM APPEARS, STRIKES JAMES ON THE HEAD. James slips to the floor, lies
still. Evelyn looks at his inert form with shock, then to Malcolm.
Malcolm speaks quietly, words for Evelyn to commit to memory. Her story, her alibi, a tale
to be told to the police.
MALCOLM
(dead calm)
James broke into the house. He was angry, he was crazy.
He killed Jeffrey and now he came back to kill you. A
poor, helpless widow. But you were ready for him,
Evelyn. You got your gun ... and you shot James until he
was dead.
HOLD ON Evelyn for a beat. Malcolm before her. James helpless on the floor.
FADE TO BLACK.

 EXT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT
Establish.
 INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT

CUT TO:

A fire burns in the hearth casting warm light about the cabin. Windom Earle peers into a
mirror, carefully affixes a false mustache to his face, other concealing facial hair. He speaks
aloud as he prepares his disguise:
EARLE
Work slowly and with care. Everything must be written
in a steady, uncompromising hand.
Leo sits at a small wooden school desk, concentrates on a piece of writing paper before him.
He painstakingly copies from an open book of poetry, produces a version in his own hand. The
shock-collar still hangs about his neck. Earle steps behind him, peers over Leo's shoulder. He
uses his flute as a yard stick or marker.
EARLE
No, no, no. Terrible.
(pointing to offending section)
Erase.
Earle produces the shock collar control, presses a button. A low-grade SHOCK shivers
through Leo's body. Leo reacts with a shudder. Then erases in haste, looks up at Earle with
plaintive expression.
EARLE
Now. Try again. Concentrate.
Leo looks back to the paper. As if it was responsible for the shocks that course through him.
He puts pen to paper. But he errs again.
EARLE
(with manic disgust)
Oh, Leo. For heaven's sake.
Another stinging shock. Leo turns, as if to flee. But Earle is upon him. He grabs Leo's hand in
an iron grip.
EARLE
Let me show you.
Earle guides Leo's hand to the paper. And carefully leads him through the difficult section.
There is something odd and tender about Earle's actions. As teacher to pupil. Father to son.







 
EARLE
See? Like this. There you go. Much better. Now you
finish.
A beat. Leo proceeds, afraid, but more determined somehow. Earle watches with satisfaction
as Leo completes the unseen document. He gives Leo a friendly pat on the head.
EARLE
I am proud of you, Leo.
Leo looks up it Earle, eager to curry his favor, whispers.
LEO
Windom ... Earle...
EARLE
(pleased)
Yes. Windom.
Earle picks up Leo's work. THREE child-like VALENTINES. In the center of each heart is
a picture: Shelly, Donna, and Aubrey. They are surveillance photos. Leo has written their
names on each valentine.
EARLE
Pretty words for pretty girls. Which one will be my
Queen?
LEO
(fairly mindless repetition)
Queen ...
Earle carefully tears the page into vertical thirds . Leo reacts with a protesting groan.
No...

LEO

Earle looks at him sharply. Leo cowers at his school-desk. Earle produces three identical
envelopes, one for each torn third.
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
START CLOSE ON Aubrey dressed as Scarlett O'Hara, in hoop skirt and bonnet.






A surreal tableau follows. Grant's surrender as enacted by Ben Horne (as the victorious General
Lee), Dr. Jacoby (as the vanquished General Grant), Jerry Horne (as Wilmer McLean), Aubrey
(as daughter McLean) and Bobby (as the miserable Bugle Boy).
Ben pauses, midroom, surveys the small table at its center, the players grouped about him.
Aubrey steps forward with a smile.
AUDREY
(playing it up, and playing it well)
Welcome to our humble home, General Lee.
BEN
Thank you. You are ...?
AUDREY
Scarlett McLean. This is my father.
Aubrey gestures toward Jerry in his farmer's suit. But Jerry misses his cue, stands frozen with
stage fright. So Aubrey repeats:
AUDREY
(a little louder)
This is my father.
Jerry reacts, hurries forward, still clutching Ben's sword.
JERRY
(the world's worst southern accent)
Wilmer McLean at your service. I'm indeed honored to
make your extremely suitable acquaintance.
(offers the stagiest of bows)
BEN
Why are you armed with my sword?
JERRY
(stumped, remaining in bowed posture)
I ... like your sword. Sire.
Ben frowns, surrounded by idiots no matter which universe he inhabits. Aubrey ushers Jerry to
the side.

 





AUDREY
Thank you, Daddy.
BEN
(checking his watch, anachronism be damned)
Where is General Grant?
JERRY
(doing his best/worst to contribute)
General Grant's a-comin', sire. I know'd it.

An awkward beat. Jacoby remains in hiding. Someone's missed their cue. Jerry looks at
Aubrey. Aubrey frowns, shoots a look at Bobby. Bobby plays a hasty toot on the bugle. The
cue Jacoby's been waiting for. A beat. And he steps forward, with as much diginity as
stepping from behind a curtain allows, into the room. Ben reacts to the odd entrance, ignores
it. And extends a hand.
BEN
General Grant.
General Lee.

JACOBY

AUDREY
(taking charge)
Please, gentlemen. Sit down.
She gestures toward the small round table. They sit.
BEN
We once met during the Mexican War. Do you
remember?
JACOBY
(calling upon high school drama training,
sticking to the script)
I have come to surrender the North.
Ben reacts. Is he the only sane man in the room?
BEN
(trying to carry on an actual conversation)
The Mexican War. Do you remember?
JACOBY
(backing and filling)
It was a good war as I remember.
BEN
Nonsense. All wars are nothing more than madness




 (3)





BEN 
disguised as the patriotic ventures of politicians too old
or cowardly to participate in them. I have no love of
war. And even less for politicians.
JACOBY
(a little dazed by the outburst)
Me neither.
BEN
(wondering if this can possibly be Grant)
But as for the men who fight them...
(living the moment)
Well. They have my eternal respect and sympathy.
(with a sigh)
Very well, General. Enough fruitless conversation. My
terms. Federal officers may keep their side arms and
general possessions. Officers and men claiming to own
horses may keep them too. And each officer and man
will be allowed to return to his home, not to be
disturbed by the Confederate States' authorities.
JACOBY
(eager to complete the process)
I surrender.

Ben pauses. Rewriting history wasn't supposed to be like this. He sighs.
BEN
Of course you do. The articles ... ?
Ben looks about, no paper on the desk. Jerry hurries forward, having missed his cue.
JERRY
The articles, sire.

Sir.

Sir.

BEN
(finally correcting)
JERRY
(retreats bowing and scraping)

BEN
(offering him a pen)
General Grant. You will sign?
Yes.

JACOBY

JACOBY 
(finally rising to the occasion)
And may I add that you have been a valiant opponent of
both noble bearing and fine character. Qualities happily
reflected in the hearts and minds of your brave men.
BEN
(genuinely flattered)
Thank you.
Jacoby signs. He hands the pen to Ben. Ben signs as well. Jerry reveals a harmonica, begins to
PLAY the Battle Hymn of the Republic in the background.
BOBBY AND AUDREY look on from the perimeter. Bobby turns to Aubrey.
BOBBY
(sotto voce)
I thought the North won the Civil War...
Aubrey rolls her eyes. Ben and Jacoby stand, shake hands a second time. Jerry steps closer,
playing loudly now. Ben gets fully into the spirit of the moment, tears gather in his eyes, he's
at the pinnacle again, he's triumphed over inestimable odds ... and FAINTS dead away.
Daddy!

AUDREY

Jerry, Jacoby, and Aubrey gather about the fallen General. Jacoby loosens his collar. Bobby
stands just behind them.
JACOBY
Give him room.
Ben!

JERRY

AUDREY
Daddy, can you hear me? Daddy?
A beat. Then, a long last, Ben's eyes flutter ... and open. He speaks:
Where am I?
Twin Peaks.

BEN
JERRY

BEN
(gazing up at them)
I had the strangest dream. You were there, and you, and you...










 (5)
BEN 
(he spots Bobby behind them)
Who are you?
BOBBY
Bobby Briggs. Sir.
Oh.

BEN

(back to the dream)
It was incredible. There was a war. And I was a
General. General Lee. And somehow, despite
incredible odds against me, I won. It ... well. I know
it's impossible. But you were all there. And I was too.
AUDREY
Bur you're back now, Daddy. You're home.
Yes. I am.

BEN

JERRY
Atta boy, Ben.
JACOBY
How do you feel? Any aftereffects. Dizziness?
BEN
To tell you the truth...
(beat, as if to check)
I feel terrific. I feel like...
Yes ...?

JERRY

AUDREY
What is it, Daddy?
BEN
(noticing)
What in the world are you doing in those clothes?
Jerry does a little impromptu dance of celebration. Aubrey hugs her father. Dr. Jacoby sits
back on his heels, still wearing his tattered uniform. Bobby plays a rolling figure on his
trumpet.

 EXT. MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT
CAMERA TRACKS toward the house, a moving POV, now peering through a window
inside. Evelyn kneels by James on the floor. Malcom enters the living room carrying a pistol in his
right hand. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Donna looking through the window, reacting to the
horrifying scene within.
CUT TO:

 INT. MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT
Malcom holds the gun toward Evelyn, grip-end first.

MALCOM
The story rings a little truer with your fingerprints on the
gun.
EVELYN
(rising to her feet)
No. I can't...
MALCOM
Just your prints. Leave the rest to me.
Malcom forces the gun into Evelyn's hand. Then produces a glove, slips it on his right hand.
MALCOM
I'll do my best to imitate the actions of a hysteric. Five
shots, tightly grouped. Like the gun went off in your
hand. Repeatedly.
Glove on, Malcom holds out his hand for the gun. But Evelyn hesitates, steps back from him.
Evelyn...?

MALCOM

Just then: Donna races into the living room.
NO!!

DONNA

Malcom whirls about. Donna races to James, kneels to hold him in her arms. To protect him
from further harm. James stirs, barely conscious.
JAMES
(faintly)
Donna...?
DONNA
(looking up at Malcom and Evelyn)
Don't hurt him. Please. Don't hurt him anymore.


 





MALCOM
(eyes on Donna and James, holds out hand)
The gun, Evelyn.
DONNA
(pleading for their lives)
I called the police. They're coming. You'll never get
away with this...
Malcom...

EVELYN

MALCOM
She's lying. Give me the gun.
DONNA
(directing her whispered plea toward Evelyn)
Don't do it. Please don't let us die.
MALCOM
(holding out gloved hand for the gun)
Evelyn.

No.

EVELYN
(after a beat, softly)

Malcom whirls about. Finds Evelyn gawking fondly at the young lovers. The gun held tightly
in her hand.
EVELYN
I can't do it. I won't.
There is a transcendant determination in her voice. A soul reclaimed. Malcom darkens.
I will.

MALCOM

He steps forward, means to wrest the gun from Evelyn's hands. But Evelyn FIRES, a bullet
slams into Malcom's chest. He staggers, looks down at the wound with surprise. He steps
toward Evelyn, the gun smoking in her outstretched hand. But his legs fail him. Malcom
staggers, Malcom falls dead to the floor. A beat. Donna weeps, cradles James in her arms.
Evelyn drops the gun. And in a voice totally devoid of emotion, begins to recite the story
Malcom taught her.
EVELYN
He was angry, he was crazy. He killed Jeffrey and he
came back to kill me. But I was ready for him. I got
my gun. And I shot him. I shot him until he was dead...
A distant siren wails.

 EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT
Establish.
CUT TO:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
A man pauses in the hotel lobby. It is Windom Earle in disguise. Earle looks about, reacts. He
SEES Agent Cooper step into view. Earle walks quickly to a pillar nearby, hides behind it.
Meanwhile, Cooper steps through the lobby after a long day. He walks past Earle in hiding,
continues. Then reacts, as if he'd felt someone's eyes upon him. Cooper turns, takes a closer
look... but there is no one to be seen. Earle has moved on. Cooper shrugs, steps inside the
waiting elevator.
A beat. Earle steps to reception, pleased with his subterfuge. He watches the elevator door
close, turns to hand an envelope to the night clerk.
EARLE
For Miss Aubrey Horne.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Cooper enters his room, removes jacket and gun. Then he pauses, notices something ahead. A
strange shape beneath his bedspread where the pillow lies. Cooper steps closer, carefully pulls
it back.
A plaster deathmask has been set upon his pillow. The face of a beautiful woman. Caroline.
Cooper stares at the mask for a long, long beat. His heart floods with sad memory. Then,
careful not to break it, Cooper lifts the mask off his bed. Beneath it ... a small tape recorder,
now activated by the mask's removal. Cooper reacts, waits. And hears the familiar VOICE
of Windom Earle.
EARLE'S VOICE
Breathtaking, wasn't she? A truly beautiful woman,
Caroline. Funny, after all this time, after all that
happened in Pittsburgh ... I still love her. And I know
that you do too ...
(beat)
Now, Dale. Listen carefully. It's your move ...
FADE TO BLACK.

THE END



ACT ONE


INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING
CLOSE ON the DEATH MASK laying on the desk. Next to it, the TAPE PLAYER is
broadcasting the VOICE of Windom Earle. PULL BACK to reveal COOPER sitting
opposite TRUMAN - both listening.
EARLE'S VOICE
Now, Dale. Listen carefully. It's your move. And please, put your heart
into it, will you? I've noticed a certain tentative quality in your thinking, as
if your mind were occupied with issues other than those on the board
before you. Such preoccupation not only weakens one's resolve, but one's
foresight as well. A deadly failing in any match, you must agree. But in
this particular contest, quite disasterous, as we play for grave stakes, the
likes of which you have no doubt surmised.
(stern and cold)
Print your move in tomorrow's paper. Or I will make it for you.
TRUMAN (the tape runs out)
Cooper, I'm not letting you out of my sight.
COOPER
If Windom wanted to kill me, I'd already be dead. Get
Pete on the phone.
TRUMAN (into intercom)
Lucy, call Pete Martel, tell him to get over here, then call
the paper, find out the latest possible deadline for
tomorrow's personal column.
Truman turns off the intercom looking up at Cooper. But Cooper's staring at the mask...
TRUMAN
She was beautiful.
COOPER
(a beat, memory consumes)
She was the love of my life.



INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - MORNING

CUT TO:

ANDREW PACKARD and CATHERINE MARTELL sit at the kitchen table, sipping
coffee. In the background, Pete's in the kitchen on the phone.
PETE
(into phone)
Okay, Lucy, tell Harry I'm on my way.
He hangs up, and picks UP TWO PLATES of food, eagerly scurries in from the kitchen,
serving Catherine her breakfast first, then Andrew, who looks down and bursts out laughing.








On his plate are scrambled eggs with a smiley face made out of crumbled bacon. Toast
points make the ears.
CATHERINE
(irritated)
Pete, salt and pepper?
PETE
Nobody knows, the trouble I've seen...
Eyes twinkling, slave to Catherine's every whim, Pete softly sings. Andrew laughs all over
again.
CATHERINE
Please, God help me, please, confine your singing to the
shower. Salt and pepper...?
PETE
Okay, Poodle, comin' right up.
Pete goes into the kitchen, still laughing.
CATHERINE
You two bring out the worst in each other.
ANDREW
Pete's a prince of a man.
CATHERINE
A court jester, more likely.
Pete returns with the salt and pepper shakers, wearing his hat and coat.
PETE
I gotta mosey.
He and Andrew try to slap the other on the head, each ducking out of the way - their age-proof
goodbye, then Pete, in a burst of familial enthusiasm, kisses Catherine on the cheek.
PETE
Goodbye, sweet Packards!
He leaves. Catherine looks at Andrew, unable to hide her distaste.
ANDREW
Catherine, Catherine... I'd always halfway hoped that age
and time would mellow the tempest raging inside you.







(2)
CATHERINE
(pushes her breakfast away, takes a lemon out of
the fruit bowl, slices it)
Watching you two act like the Hardy Boys always brings
on stormy weather. What's happening with Ghostwood?
ANDREW
I spoke with our investors, the meeting's set. I fly to Paris
tomorrow.
CATHERINE
Andrew... I've been thinking... about a shopping mall.
ANDREW
Near the industrial park?
CATHERINE (with relish)
No, right next to the Great Northern. Adjacent to the
new hotel I want to build.
ANDREW
I'm sure Ben will... appreciate the competition.
CATHERINE
(she bites into the lemon)
I think it's the least I can do, don't you?
(pausing to peer out window)
Oh, good. Company.
The back door opens and JOSIE walks in carrying a bundle of kindling. She stops cold,
staring at Andrew - it can't be. She drops the wood, and moves closer, eyes wide with horror.
ANDREW
Dear Josie. I'm home. Did you miss me?
Josie PASSES OUT cold. Neither Andrew or Catherine move. Pause.
ANDREW
She seems surprised.
CATHERINE
Poor thing. Couldn't even pull off a simple murder.
ANDREW
She has her charms, though.
CATHERINE
True. But not for long.
CUT TO:






INT. SHERIFF'S TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Harry looks down at a SEATTLE NEWSPAPER featuring JONATHAN'S PHOTO and
the HEADLINE: "NO CLUES TO KILLER." Truman loathes his own suspicions. There's a
KNOCK on the door. HAWK opens the door wide, making enough room for himself and
HANK, who hobbles in, handcuffed to his crutches. Truman tenses, in no mood for this.
HANK
(friendly)
Hello, Harry.
Hank makes a mock attempt to shake hands - making a point. Truman gives him a long look.
TRUMAN
Save it, Hank.
HANK
Jeez, did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this
morning? I broke parole! Cry me a river.
TRUMAN
You crossed the border into Canada, we have photographs
of you consorting with felons at Dead Dog Farm and I'm
charging you with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
HANK
Ouch. Okay. Well. I think it's safe to assume that I was
at the diner the night Leo was plugged, but you're
welcome to TRUMAN
I've got a witness puts you at the scene with a gun in your
hand. You are one cat that just used up his ninth life.
HANK
(pause, playing his trump card)
Harry, you obviously seem serious about this, so I'm
going to modestly propose a trade. How about
information leading to the arrest and conviction of
Andrew Packard's murderer. Hank Jennings, witness for
the prosecution.
No deals.

TRUMAN

HANK
You're going to tell me you care more about the
attempted murder of Leo Johnson, felon, than you do
about Andrew Packard? How's that gonna go over with
your constituents 







TRUMAN
You're through in my town, Hank.
HANK
(his last shot)
My guess is, Harry, not too well, especially once people
find out who pushed the button on Andrew and that you've
been sleeping with her Truman goes white with rage. Pause. Hawk kicks out one of Hank's crutches, he goes down.
Gee, I sorry.

HAWK

Hank's on the floor, gasping with pain.
TRUMAN
Get him out of my sight.
Hawk hurries to remove Hank. Truman collapses in his chair: it can't be true.


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

CUT TO:

CLOSE on the table: MORGUE PHOTOS and VICUNA COAT SAMPLES on the table.
ALBERT ROSENFIELD pulls out two plastic envelopes, both contain a single bullet.
ALBERT
This is the bullet we removed from you ...
(re: the other)
... this one was excavated from the dead man's skull.
He indicates a MORGUE PHOTO of the back of JONATHAN'S HEAD.
ALBERT (Cont'd)
Same bullets, same gun, same killer. Let's go get her.
COOPER
Albert, hold your horses.
ALBERT
Coop, I appreciate any reluctance you might have for
busting your pal's old lady, but the woman ventilated you
and left you for dead COOPER
I don't take it personally. What about the gloves, powder
tests?









ALBERT
News at five.
(Cooper's relieved - a little more time)
Fine, maybe you're not mad, but there's an epidemic of
multiple gunshot wounds following this chick around.
She's a menace.

Pause. Cooper moves to the door.
COOPER
I'll talk to her. Maybe she'll confess, turn herself in.
ALBERT
Maybe she'll grow wings and join the circus.


INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO:

AUDREY, dressed for success, walks across the lobby carrying a stack of manila file folders
to the Concierge Desk, where the concierge, EMILE LAZARE, officiates.
AUDREY
(eager to pitch in)
Emile, I've got a list of all our "non-repeat" guests. We're
going to send them a special invitation from the Great
Northern.
Emile shoves an AUDREY name tag toward her as she sits down. He smiles thinly,
supercillious:
EMILE
Your enthusiasm brings a salty tear to the eye. However, I
think you will find my job requires more than tight
sweaters and a perky attitude.
AUDREY
(trying to be pleasant, putting on tag)
Emile, I'm learning the business, every week a different
department. I don't want your job.
EMILE
I look forward to your stint in housekeeping.
(hands her an envelope)
This came for you this morning. Good luck, Miss Horne.
You'll need it.
Emile turns his back and walks away. Audrey glares after, hurt, angry. She rips open the
envelope. A voice intrudes:
WHEELER'S VOICE
Excuse me, I just checked in to room 207..?










AUDREY
(muttered)
Congratulations.
WHEELER'S VOICE
... They told me at the front desk I should talk to AUDREY
(exasperated)
WHAT can I do for you?!?

Audrey finally looks up, right into the smoldering eyes of JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER full on knock-down-drag-out handsome. Wheeler meets her glare with a friendly smile.
Simple, uncomplicated.
WHEELER
Sorry. I thought you were working.
AUDREY
I am working. See?
Audrey slaps her hands through the papers and files atop the concierge desk. Tantrum
exorcised, she looks back to the handsome stranger, manages a more business-like mien.
WHEELER
(looking at her name tag)
Audrey ... Horne?
AUDREY
(deadpan)
At your service.
WHEELER
(the same easy manner)
Good. I need a fax machine installed in my room as soon
as possible.
AUDREY
(grabbing paper, pen; she wants to get this over
with)
I can handle that.
WHEELER
And I'm wondering if you could send somebody out to
the airport. I'm carrying some heavy equipment on this
trip that they didn't have room for on the van.
AUDREY
What flight were you on?








(2)
WHEELER
My own. It's the only jet out there. Shouldn't be too hard
to find.
Audrey looks at him - blue jeans, t-shirt, cowboy boots - a jet!? She deadpans:
AUDREY
Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Rockefeller?
WHEELER
No. That's all for now. Thanks.
Wheeler steps away. Audrey takes a closer look. Wheeler pivots, smiles.
WHEELER
I have a picture of you. Little dirndl skirt, white apron,
long braids. Unbelievably cute.
AUDREY
I don't wear dirndl.
WHEELER
You did then. Right here in the Great Northern dining
room. If I close my eyes I can almost see it. Audrey
Horne as "Heidi". Unforgettable.
AUDREY

"Heidi"?
(remembering, mortified)
I was ten. How did you...? Hey!
Too late. Wheeler's gone. Audrey watches him step through the lobby, anger now leavened
with curiosity. A beat. She looks down at the envelope. Pulls out a vertically torn piece of
paper, reading part of a POEM:
I have dreamed
walked so much
I have to do now
Phantoms and a ghost
Ghost who walks
Of
With it, a separate INVITATION: Save the One you Love. Please attend gathering of Angels
tonight at the Roadhouse, 9: Audrey looks up, sees Wheeler get into the elevator.
FADE OUT.

ED is reading the newspaper when NADINE bursts in the front door.
ED
(standing)
Nadine, what are you doing home from school?
(puts his arm around her, fatherly)
Are you feeling poorly?

NADINE
(deeply serious)
Eddie, we have to talk.
Okay.

ED

They sit on the sofa. Long pause.

NADINE (Cont'd)
I just feel like... more and more... like we're... you
know.... Kind of... well... growing apart?

ED
I've noticed that too.
NADINE
(pause, then in a rush)
Oh Eddie, I better tell you before you hear it from the
kids at school. Mike and I are in love.
In love.

ED









NADINE (it all pours out)
I hope you're not hurt, I wouldn't want to hurt you for
anything in the world, honest, you have to believe that. But
Mike and I... on the wrestling trip, we had the most
magical night together.
All night?

ED

NADINE
Well, you and Norma did it!
ED
(pause, trying to be fair)
That's fair. So Nadine, what does this mean?
NADINE
(compassionate)
Eddie, we have to call a spade a spade. We're breaking
up. And as soon as my parents come home, it'd probably
be best if you moved back in with your folks. Eddie... I
am so sorry.
Ed nods. He's not, but he's straining not to show it.


INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

CUT TO:

Josie and Cooper sit on the couch. Josie's fidgets nervously, won't look Cooper in the eye.
COOPER
Josie, this is your last chance to level with me about what
happened in Seattle.
JOSIE
(she doesn't)
I told you, how many times do I have to say it, I escaped
from Jonathan at the airport. After that, I don't know
what happened to him.
COOPER
Do you understand that I could arrest you right now?
Josie cowers.

INT. BLUE PINE LIVING ROOM
COOPER
I'm here as a friend... of Harry's. I don't know what place
he occupies in your heart, but I know you own his.
Wouldn't you want a chance to try and explain this to him
before Please go.

JOSIE

Josie looks away. Cooper stands.
COOPER
There's nowhere for you to run.
(pauses, dreading it)
I'll give you until six. If you're not at the station house by
then, I'll come back for you.
He leaves. Josie doesn't move, the noose tightens.
Catherine pretends to have just come in the back door. She sashays through the living room.
CATHERINE
Josie! I just saw Agent Cooper leave, was this a social
call?
Josie doesn't respond, staring into space.
CATHERINE (Cont'd)
Dear, you look awful. Is everything all right?
JOSIE
(standing, shakey)
I don't feel well.
CATHERINE
I'm sorry. Well, I wish I had better news. I've spoken to
Mr. Eckhardt again, on your behalf. He's not entirely
unsympathetic, but he does insist on seeing you alone.
Tonight.
JOSIE
(beaten)
He'll kill me.









CATHERINE
To tell you the truth, my biggest worry is what he'll do if
he finds out that Andrew is alive. Won't Mr. Eckhardt
think you betrayed him?
(then fake cheer)
But of course you can always plead ignorance; after all,
you did think Andrew was dead.
Josie holds her head, truly being driven crazy.
JOSIE
Catherine, please. Help me. I don't know what to do. I
feel like I'm going mad...
CATHERINE
Josie, you're going to have to face Mr. Eckhardt sooner or
later. Tell him the truth. Tell him anything you desire.
Just pray he'll believe it. Now where did I leave my
keys....?
Catherine rustles through a draw desk drawer, reveals a HANDGUN. She grabs her keys, steps
away. Josie pauses, stricken, eyes locked on the weapon. A beat. And she reaches for it.
Catherine stops to glance back at Josie from across the room. She smiles.

 INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO:

THOMAS ECKHARDT, hands his assistant, JONES, a stack of CASH. Her suitcase is
open on the bed.
ECKHARDT
The entire amount.
(Jones reacts, pleased)
I trust you'll finish the job, regardless of what happens
tonight.
(he catches her hand as she takes the money)
Surely you of all people know what happens when my trust
is violated.
He pulls a GAROTTE out of her bracelet, wraps it around her wrists. Kisses her.
ECKHARDT
Check out. Drive north, for a day. I'll wrap up my affairs
and be gone by morning. Come back tomorrow night and
finish up.
JONES
(smiling)
Yes sir.

CUT TO:






 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Order has been restored. Around the conference table are the GREAT NORTHERN
BOARD MEMBERS: BEN, Audrey, and JERRY, who is making black olive paste canapes.
BOBBY BRIGGS stands next to Ben's desk, hanging up a phone.
BOBBY
No answer, Ben. He must be on his way.
BEN
(calm and affable)
Thank you, lad. Join us, will you? Board Meetings are
usually nothing more than a gathering of self-minded
individuals more intent than the next on financial
gain. But today, well, today will be something
completely different.

Bobby hurries to his seat. Audrey smiles at the new eager beaver, as the door opens behind her.
BEN
Ahh. Here he is now. Jack, you're a sight for sore eyes.
Are we taking good care of you?
Audrey reacts, stunned to see the man with the jet, now dressed in a beautiful Armani suit.
Ben embraces Wheeler like a long-lost son. Wheeler smiles at Audrey.
WHEELER
My luggage just arrived. Thank you, Audrey.
BEN
You two have met?
AUDREY
(a little cold)
Briefly.
BEN
(by way of introduction)
John Justice Wheeler. Used to work construction, came up
the hard way.
AUDREY
How nice for him.







 
BEN
(motioning him into a seat)
Jack, take a seat, you know brother Jerry, of course, and
this is my executive assistant, young Bob Briggs.

Wheeler sits down between Bobby and Audrey. Audrey takes a wary look at the stranger. He
returns a smile. Jerry passes his canapes around. And Ben clears his throat, begins:
BEN
I've asked Mr. Wheeler to our board. Years ago, I
invested in him, a pittance he built into an empire. I take
no credit. But I believed in Jack, even when he was just
another local boy pounding nails. I have asked him to
return the favor by believing, in me now.
Wheeler nods assent. Ben pauses with requisite drama, at least long enough for Jerry to finish
chomping on a rather hefty canape... and begins:

BEN
(slowly pacing around them)
Horne Industries Incorporated have fallen on hard times.
The mill and Ghostwood lands are now solely owned by
Catherine Martell. We don't begrudge her the mill, it was
and is, after all, hers. But we sweated blood to make
Ghostwood ours for a doggone decade. Retail revenues at
the department store are down fourteen percent. And as
for the hotel, well, let's just say it's off-season and leave it
at that.
JERRY
Ben, over in Sicily, I had a marketing brainstorm. We set
up a special package deal: Twin Peaks, Land of Crime.
See where Laura Palmer was murdered, see where her
body was found, visit Maddy Ferguson's final resting
place; I call it the Homicide Getaway 






 (2)

Everyone looks at Jerry like he's lost his mind.
BEN
Thank you, Jer. We'll put it on the agenda for further
review.
(carrying on)
But in spite of these reversals, stripped of the trappings of
success, what are we left with? The human spirit. I've been
taking a good hard look at my own soul, and I've decided
it's high time Ben Horne gave something back to society.

JERRY
Ben, not the hotel.
BEN
No. Not the hotel. What's the greatest gift one human
being can give to another? The future.
He goes over to a DRAPED EASEL in the corner, and removes the cloth, revealing a large
Audobon-style drawing of a WEASEL.
BEN
I give you... the pine weasel - found only in our tri-county
area. Targeted by the Environmental Defense League and
the Wilderness Society. Nearly extinct.
JERRY
They're incredible roasted. A ginger and garlic
marinade, a glass of sauvignon blanc BEN
(cutting him off)
According to an environmental impact report I
commissioned, what few pine weasels remain...
(as though Jerry had eaten them all)
... will be all but wiped out by the Packard plans for
Ghostwood development.







 (3)
BOBBY
(appalled and amazed)
You wanna "save the pine weasel"?
BEN
Not just the pine weasel. Life as we know it. I want
Twin Peaks to remain unspoiled in an era of vast
environmental carnage.
AUDREY
But development is progress: people, money.
WHEELER
Not always. Ben if I could interrupt Please, Jack.

BEN

WHEELER
What Ben's talking about is quality of life, something we
don't consider much in the business world. It's my
experience that a corporation like Horne Industries is not
just a vehicle for making money, but for expressing values
too.
Audrey looks at Wheeler, irked by the interruption, interested too.
JERRY
(whispering to Ben)
So we block Catherine's development until the wheel turns
and we get another shot. Brilliant Ben, brilliant.
BEN
(stands, takes the floor again)
I intend to fight the Ghostwood development on every
ground with every available weapon. This little weasel is
about to become a household word.
Then what?

AUDREY

Ben leans back, taking them all in.
BEN
(earnest)
I'm considering a run for the Senate.

 INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
SHELLY clears tables. ONE MAN sits at the counter finishing up. We MOVE IN to see
that it's WINDOM EARLE, dressed like a TRUCK DRIVER: baseball hat, flannel shirt,
jacket, and dirty jeans. He leaves some money on the counter - and an ENVELOPE.
ANGLE ON NORMA
Talking on the phone. In the background, we see Windom Earle leave.
NORMA
...Annie, it's no problem, really. I've got plenty of room.
You get on the next bus and I'll be waiting.

Okay, honey, don't cry. Things will be fine. I'll see you

God, what do you have to do to get out of a convent?
NORMA
Leave. It's not a prison.
SHELLY
Sure sounds like it to me.
(half-joking)
No TV. No boyfriends.
NORMA
(cleaning up the counter)
When she was little I always thought Annie was from
another time and place. The convent was right for her, in a
way. It's kind of hard to imagine her out in the world.
(seeing the envelope)
Here's something for you.
SHELLY
(picking it up)
Who from?






 
NORMA
I don't know. Whoever was sitting here.

Shelly opens it, removes a piece of paper, both sides ripped - clearly a companion piece to the
one Audrey received.
SHELLY
Wow, get a load of this
(reading to Norma)
So much
spoken
perhaps it is to be
a hundred times
and will walk gaily over your
(looking at Norma)
This makes no sense.
(now reading again)
Save the one you love. A gathering of angels tonight at the
Roadhouse, nine-thirty.
NORMA
Sounds romantic. Or dangerous.
SHELLY
Sounds crazy. What could this be?

The door flies open and BIG ED strides in - a man on a mission. Norma's face lights up. Ed
doesn't speak, he takes Norma's hand and leads her out from behind the counter and into his
arms. Shelly watches, wide-eyed.
ED
Norma, I've loved you every day for the past twenty years
and I've dreamed of you every night. It's time for us to be
together. Will you marry me?
Norma's completely overcome.
Ed...

NORMA




 (2)

ED
It 's finally our turn, baby. We deserve to be happy.
Ed kisses her, full of love and passion.
ON SHELLY
She smiles brightly. Dreams do come true.

END ACT TWO




ACT THREE



 EXT. WOODS - DAY
LEO sits on a tree stump, whittling a long, thin piece of wood, the SHOCK COLLAR around
Leo's neck. WINDOM EARLE walks over, pats him on the back, like a dog.
EARLE
Good job, fella.
Leo doesn't react, just keeps whittling.
EARLE (Cont'd)
Just a few more, then we'll eat.
Earle picks up one of the shafts, sings a snatch of an Irish drinking song, then ...
EARLE (Cont'd)
"Fly to my breast, pierce me in colors autumnal/Speak to
me only of love."
Leo looks at him uncomprehendingly. Earle looks back.
EARLE
Leo, you have an incomplete education.
(puts an arm around him)
For instance, survival in the wilderness a relevant issue
in your life, my friend. This comes under the heading of
practical instruction. I hope you've been paying attention.
From his pocket, he takes a DEADLY ARROWHEAD, knifepoint gleaming, and affixes it to
the shaft: an arrow. Leo gets the idea, smiles.
EARLE (Cont'd)
Nature is cruel. This is also ... a lesson.
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

CUT TO:

The JAIL. Hank's in his cell, laying down on the bed. The door opens, Norma enters.
HANK
(struggling to his feet)
Hi, honey.
Norma doesn't respond, looking at her husband through the bars.
NORMA
How do you feel?
HANK
Great, now that you're here.







 
He reaches through the bars to hold her hand. Norma doesn't move.
NORMA
Hank, I came here to ask for a divorce.
HANK
(pause)
First let me say I don't blame you. You gave me a second
chance. I blew it. I don't know why I'm so selfdestructive, but I can see now that's got to be my priority
in getting well. I've got a lot of work to do. In fact, I
decided I'm going to try to go into therapy - I don't
want to be like this anymore.
Hank closes his eyes, as though fighting back tears.
NORMA
Hank, that's... interesting. But I have to go on with my
life.
HANK
I know. I know you do. And I want you be be happy.
NORMA
(not buying in)
Thank you.
HANK
I want to ask you one last favor. I want you to help me get
out of here. If they send me back to prison I'll die. Just
tell the Sheriff I was at the restaurant the night Leo was
shot. I was on my way there, but I can't prove it. You can.
NORMA
No more lies, Hank.
HANK
It's not telling a lie. It's saving my life.
No.

NORMA

HANK
Norma, you're killing me 





 (2)
NORMA
Don't blame me for this. Don't you dare.
Pause. Anther track.
HANK
Is it Big Ed, Norma? Is that what you're running to?
(pause)
Then here's the deal: give me my alibi, I'll give you your
divorce.
NORMA
I didn't come here to negotiate. I came to say goodbye.
She starts out.
HANK
Fine, go ahead (lashing out)
You're his whore Norma!
NORMA
I'd rather be his whore, than your wife.
She exits.
Norma!!!

HANK

 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM DAY

CUT TO:

Pete, Cooper, and Truman are seated at the table - a CHESS BOARD lies in the middle.
PETE
There's four or five ways to do this. They each have their
virtues. I recall Casablanca and Lasker in St. Petersburg,
1914 COOPER
(on edge)
Pete, we've only got five minutes.
TRUMAN (into intercom)
Lucy, get the Examiner on the phone. Tell them not to
close out the personals, we need a little more time.
All eyes are on Pete - still staring at the board. Finally, he moves a pawn.






 
PETE
Okay, that's it. Guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights.
COOPER
As long as he can't take a piece off the board PETE
He can't, at least not for five or six more moves.

TRUMAN
Maybe it'll just frustrate him, maybe he'll kill anyway.
COOPER
I don't think so Earle has a sense of honor about these
things, however perverse.
TRUMAN
I never heard of a man who murdered by the rules.

Albert sticks his head in the door - motioning for Cooper.
Excuse me.

COOPER

Truman watches Cooper leave - with mounting dread. His call goes through.
TRUMAN
Sandy, this is Sheriff Truman, we've got our item ready 15A. INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY

CUT TO:

Albert leads Cooper all the way down to the other end of the hall - then faces him.
ALBERT
I've got a match on the gun that whacked you to powder
residue on Josie Packard's gloves. Seattle police have also
come up with an eyewitness who positively id'd Josie
leaving the car where they found the stiff. Now if you're
not gonna bust the bitch, I'll consider it a personal
privilege COOPER
Albert, I'll handle it.






 (2)
Cooper looks down the hall, and Harry is standing there watching them. Cooper, full of pain
and compassion, locks eyes with his friend. In that instant Harry knows the truth. He bolts out
the front door.
ALBERT
(quiet)
Looks like you just did.
 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - LATE AFTERNOON

CUT TO:

JOSIE'S ROOM. She sits at the vanity, in her slip, staring into the mirror - a doomed
woman. She picks up a lipstick, and slowly applies it on her mouth. There's a KNOCK on
her door.
Come in.

JOSIE

Andrew enters, carrying, TWO GLASSES of CHAMPAGNE.
ANDREW
I assume you still have a taste for bubbly. We killed
enough bottles in our time.
Josie takes it, confused by his kindness. He raises his glass.
ANDREW
(raising his glass)
To beginnings ... and endings. And the wisdom to know
the difference.
JOSIE
(her hands shaking)
Andrew, I'm ... sorry.
ANDREW
At first I hated you for it. Perfectly normal response. As
my anger subsided I recalled that Eckhardt has a way of
pursuading people to do ... anything. I assume it was his idea.
JOSIE
He said that you never loved me, that you just married
me to get back at him.
ANDREW
That's not true. I did love you very much. But of course,
I'm afraid the same could never be said for you.
(she starts to speak)




 

ANDREW 
Please, Josie, there's no need for lies between us.

Josie hangs her head, ashamed.
ANDREW (Cont'd)
You had a job to do and you did it. That was your choice.
Now you're paying the price. Every action has it's
consequences, my dear.
Josie looks at him, questioning.
ANDREW (Cont'd)
The police are closing in. If you don't take action, you'll
be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.
JOSIE
What can I do?... help me.
ANDREW
You must see Eckhardt. Perhaps you were meant to be
together all along. I truly believe that he loves you. He
doesn't know I'm alive. And he can get you out of the
country. Go to him, Josie. Now.
Josie nods her head, downs the rest of her champagne, literally shaking with fright. She starts
to speak again.
ANDREW (Cont'd)
Don't say anything. Let me just remember you this way.
We won't speak again.
He rises, looks at Josie one last time - so beautiful, so pathetic. Then he leaves.
CUT TO:
 EXT. MOUNTAIN - LATE AFTERNOON
Nature at it's best. DONNA sits on a quilt next to a basket of wine, cheese, and crackers. We
hear a motorcycle - it's JAMES. He dismounts, sits beside her. Both a little awkward.
It's beautiful.

JAMES

DONNA
I wanted to go somewhere we'd never been before. How'd
it go with the police?
JAMES
They asked a million questions I didn't know the answer
to. But the ones I did must've been enough. Evelyn's gonna






 



JAMES 
stand trial. I'll be a witness.
(noticing her hand, guilty)
You're still wearing the ring.

Donna looks at the ring James gave her.
DONNA
I know about you and Evelyn.
JAMES
I don't blame you for hating me...
DONNA
(very clear)
Listen to me. I know what you were feeling, because I was
feeling it too. And I believe Evelyn took advantage of
that.
JAMES
It was wrong. I should have known it was.
DONNA
James. You can feel bad about what happened for you. But
I don't want you to feel bad for me.
JAMES
(overwhelmed by her compassion)
I love you.
They come together in a healing embrace, remain in each other's arms throughout. A long beat,
then, quiet and sad:
DONNA
I remember when I thought love was simple. But look at
us. Nothing we do seems to matter. Maybe love isn't
enough.
JAMES
If we could just start over...
DONNA
(with faint doubt)
Come home with me.
JAMES
I can't. Not right now.
Donna pauses. She's knows what's best for James. No matter how much it hurts. That's why
she brought him here.



 (2)
DONNA
Then go. Ride as far away as you can.
JAMES
But what about you?
DONNA
You can't worry about me any more. I've been a part of all
the horrible things that happened. From now on I want to
be part of something good. Go, James. Take all the time
you need.
Donna pauses, determined not to cry. She reaches in her pocket, and pulls out an ENVELOPE.
DONNA
It's not much, but what's babysitting money for, if you
can't buy your best friend a present.
(smiles, wipes away a fugitive tear)
I'll miss you like crazy, but you'll come back and tell me
a bunch of great stories. And none of them will be about
Laura, or Maddy, or Evelyn. I'll be here. And we can
start over again.
JAMES
Come with me.
No.

DONNA (gently)

JAMES
I'll come back for you. I promise I'll Donna silences him with a kiss, sweet and tender. Their embrace deepens. They tumble
down and make love.
END ACT THREE







ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
Catherine is curled up in front of the fire, sipping a cup of tea, reading a book. (Dostoyevsky's
Crime and Punishment). Pete sits in his chair, meticulously TYING FLIES. A KNOCK on
the door. Catherine gives Pete a look: she's not about to get up.
PETE
(moving everything off his lap)
Coming.
He shuffles over to the door, and opens it on a very distraught Sheriff Truman.
TRUMAN
Pete, I need to see Josie.
PETE
C'mon in. I think she went out.
CATHERINE
(moving quickly into the room)
Yes, Sheriff, it's a little odd. She took my car, without
saying a word.
PETE
She told me the Great Northern.
CATHERINE
(she could kill him)
Did she? Well, she took a lot of things with her. I don't
know where she was going, but I'd say she was planning to
stay awile.
TRUMAN
What else did she say, Pete?
PETE
Said she was seeing an old friend.
CATHERINE
(with significance)
Oh. Him.
(gives Truman a sympathetic look)
I suppose it's been hard on all of us. Learning the truth
about Josie.
Truman storms over to the phone and quickly dials.



 

CATHERINE
(to Pete, without much sympathy)
Poor man.
TRUMAN
(into phone)
Agent Cooper's room, please.
(after a beat)
It's me. I'm coming over.

 INT. GREAT NORTHERN ELEVATOR - NIGHT




CUT TO:

Eckhardt enters the elevator. Pushes a button. The MAN whose back is to him turns. It's Packard.
ANDREW
Thomas. We meet again.
Eckhardt is shocked. The doors close. Andrew pushes a button to stop the car between floors.
Eckhardt reaches for a gun.
ANDREW
That won't be necessary. As unlikely as it may sound, I'm
here as a friend. Honestly, Thomas, put the gun away. I'm
unarmed. Look if you like.
(raises his arms to be searched, Eckhardt still
holds the gun)
Very well, then. If it makes you more comfortable.
ECKHARDT
This is somewhat awkward.
ANDREW
(laughing)
Yes, of course. It's not every day you're obliged to
converse with the dead. Look closer, Thomas. I am alive.
How?

ECKHARDT

ANDREW
Guess. It's really very simple.

Josie.

ECKHARDT
(feeling the weight of this betrayal)

ANDREW
(a lie)
She warned me off herself. Couldn't bear to see her
beloved husband perish. Or, more realistically, I suppose,
she felt there was some advantage to be gained. Whatever
the case, when the True Love went up there was no one on
board. Damn shame, if you ask me. I placed more value




 




ANDREW 
in that boat than in most people I know. Josie included.
ECKHARDT
She betrayed me.
ANDREW
We are all familiar with betrayal.
ECKHARDT (puts the gun away)
I never would have tried to kill you over business.
ANDREW
Over Josie then?
ECKHARDT
You took her from me.
ANDREW
But you got her back, didn't you? At least, you thought
you did. Almost as good. Almost the same thing.
ECKHARDT (his obsession tolls)
She's mine. She belongs to me.
ANDREW
Oh, Thomas. Love will break your heart. Happily, I long
ago lost interest. But Josie, she gives her heart with
alarming regularity. The local sheriff, of all people.
ECKHARDT
I took care of that.
ANDREW
I don't doubt it. Sometimes I wonder if our Josie does
these twisted things deliberately. Don't you?
(Eckhardt reins in fury; Andrew lies with a sigh)
I do regret that our friendship had to end over someone
so... inconstant. Josie's unpredictable nature is part of her
charm, to be sure. Especially to men like us, so set in our
ways. But as I grow older, I find myself placing more
value in simple, unadorned, trust.
ECKHARDT
Is that why you came back, Andrew? To lecture me about
trust?
ANDREW
(the final prevarication)
No. As someone who was once your friend, I return with a







 (2)
ANDREW (the door opens)
Ah, here we are. This must be your floor. I'll be going
back down to the garage. My resurrection remains a wellkept secret.
ECKHARDT
(backing out of elevator, a quiet threat)
See you soon...?
ANDREW
(knowing he won't)
Goodbye, Thomas.
Andrew waves cheerfully as the doors close. Eckhardt pauses to wonder, then steps away.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Ben, Audrey, and Wheeler are finishing their dinner.
BEN
... I know I have a lot to learn. And you Jack, will be my
teacher. Think of me as an open book, upon whose virgin
pages you shall scribe.
Audrey nearly chokes on her dessert. Ben pats her on the back.
AUDREY (suspicious)
What exactly do you do, Mr. Wheeler?
WHEELER
Call me Jack. I buy bankrupt, failing businesses,
streamline them, bring them up to speed, and then,
usually, sell them.
BEN
And at a substantial profit. But not, I should add, before
making significant environmental concessions. When
Jack's finished, the waste is re-routed, the air cleaner, the
people happier.
WHEELER (modest to a fault)
You make me sound like Santa Claus. I'm a businessman,
that's all.

The Maitre d' whispers in Ben's car. He nods and stands.






 
BEN
Excuse me, the Cook just tried to stab Jerry. You kids
carry on.
(to Audrey, re Wheeler)
Audrey, pay attention.
He hurries off. Audrey turns to Wheeler, fixes him with a level stare. She's determined to
remain unimpressed. And she won't call him 'Jack.'
AUDREY
So which is it, Mr. Wheeler? Are we bankrupt or just
failing?
WHEELER
I'm here to do an old friend a favor.
AUDREY
My father's friends are rarer than the Pine Weasel.
WHEELER
Ben was once a very good friend to me.
AUDREY
(with quiet contempt)
And so you came back to bring us all up to speed. You are
Santa Claus, Mister Wheeler. I better hang my stocking.
WHEELER (after a beat)
You don't like me much, do you Audrey?
AUDREY
I don't have an opinion either way.
WHEELER
But if you did?
AUDREY (cool and calm)
If I did, I'd say that the Hornes have managed to take care
of themselves just fine for more years than you can count.
And, desperate though we may seem, will probably
continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
Audrey's matching his direct tone, adding a little bit of her father's flamboyance. She waits
for Wheeler to respond, react. A beat. And he begins to laugh.
AUDREY
What's so funny?






 (2)

WHEELER
I was just remembering. Heidi, it's no big deal...
AUDREY
Heidi again. I was ten, I don't know what that has to do
with anything...
WHEELER (remembering)
Somehow, Ben convinced Pete Martell to play the Goat.
He had these horns on, and you know Pete, he'd bleat and
baah to wake the dead, loud enough that we couldn't hear
poor Heidi's lines. So you kicked him. Hard. Right
where he lives, as I recall...

AUDREY (now laughing too)
I didn't mean to hurt him...
WHEELER(more gently)
Pete started yowling even louder, for real this time, and
precious, innocent little Heidi turned to the audience, pigtails and deep dark eyes...and smiled. Ten years old and
you made it very clear: Don't tread on me.
(beat)
Sorry. It's just that a minute ago I was starting to feel
like one of Heidi's goats. Sparked a memory.
AUDREY
(charmed in spite of herself)
Where have you been all this time? I mean, when you
weren't rescuing widows and orphans and making our
world a better place to live in.
WHEELER
The far corners of the earth. It's glorious out there,
Audrey. But all in all, it's nice be back home.
Wheeler says it simply, without affect. Audrey's never met a man like him before. With a
single exception ... Agent Cooper. And that goes straight to the heart of her.



 (3)

AUDREY (sotto voce)
I'm only eighteen.
Excuse me?

WHEELER (puzzled)

AUDREY (snapping, out of it)
Nothing. I, uhm... look at the time. Tell my father,
okay? I've got an appointment. See you... Jack
Flustered, not sure exactly what she's feeling, Audrey makes a sudden exit. Wheeler sits back,
as fascinated now as he was back then ... and watches her go.
CUT TO:
 INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Shelly sits at the bar, sipping a BEER. Alone, not sure what she's waiting for. Donna walks out
of the LADIES ROOM and sees Shelly. Donna goes over.
Hi Shelly.

DONNA

SHELLY
Hi, how are you doing?
DONNA
How are you doing?
SHELLY
Okay. You know, life.
Yeah.

DONNA

(Shelly offers a cigarette)
No thanks.
SHELLY
Waiting for James?
DONNA
No, I got this weird note. Asked me to meet somebody
here.
She lays her torn piece of paper on the bar. Shelly looks at it.
SHELLY
That's weird all right.
She takes out her own piece of paper, and lays it down next to Donna's. Two pieces of the same
puzzle. Then a THIRD PIECE OF PAPER is laid down next to the other two - the puzzle is
complete.








 
They look up - it's Audrey.
AUDREY
Looks like we have all something to talk about.
DONNA
They fit together.
SHELLY
(reading the pieced together poem)
I have dreamed so much of you
walked so much, spoken, lain with your phantom...
That all I have to do now perhaps is to be a phantom
among phantoms and a ghost hundred times...
More than the ghost who walks gaily over the sun-dial of
your life.
CAMERA MOVE to reveal Windom Earle, in disguise, sitting in another part of the
Roadhouse watching them.
CUT TO:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
Sheriff Truman strides through the lobby over to the HOUSE PHONE. He picks it up.
TRUMAN
(into phone)
Agent Cooper, please.
 INT. COOPER'S ROOM

INTERCUT

Cooper's loading his pistol. The PHONE RINGS, he uncoils, answering it.
COOPER
Cooper ... yes, Catherine. No, I was just on my way out
there - she's here now? Thomas Eckhardt, all right ...
Truman still on the phone.
OPERATOR'S VOICE
(from phone)
I'm sorry, that line is still busy.
Truman hangs up and heads for the elevators.
 INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

CUT TO:

Cooper walks down a hall and around a corner. We HEAR SHOUTING. Cooper moves
more quickly.



 



MAN'S VOICE
(from inside one of the rooms)
Say it, SAY YOU DON'T LOVE HIM!!

Cooper now stands outside the door.
WOMAN'S VOICE
No! Not as long as I live...
MAN'S VOICE
Then you won't.
Cooper kicks the door open - just as a SHOT is FIRED.
 INT. ECKHARDT'S SUITE

CUT TO:

Cooper bursts in on Josie lying on the bed with Eckhardt, both faces frozen, eyes wide open.
It's not clear who's done what to whom. Eckhardt rises from the bed, starts towards Cooper, a
knife in his hand. Then Cooper sees the blood seeping from the wand in his chest. Eckhardt
stops. A pause.
Josie pulls her arm out from under the covers - pointing the smoking GUN at Cooper.
Eckhardt collapses.
Josie holds the gun on Cooper. She's wearing traditional CHINESE PEASANT clothes that
are half open, half off. No make-up, looking more like the girl she used to be.
JOSIE
He tried ... he tried to kill me.
COOPER
Is that what you'll say about me? Josie, I'm not armed.
Behind Cooper, Truman steps through the open door - unseen, but listening.
COOPER
What about Jonathan? Was he trying to kill you too?
JOSIE
He was taking me back
Truman draws his gun.
COOPER
And me. Why did you shoot me, Josie?
JOISE
You asked too many questions. I knew this day was





 




JOISE 
coming. I won't go to jail. I can't.

Truman steps out into the room, points his gun at Josie.
TRUMAN
Put it down, Josie.
Josie can't bear to look at Truman. Tears roll down her face, but the gun holds steady.
Put it down.

TRUMAN

JOSIE
Harry, forgive me. I had no right to hurt you ...
She cocks the gun. Still pointed at Cooper.
TRUMAN
(cocking his own gun)
I'm begging you. Don't make me do this.
She looks at him one more time. Whispers goodbye. She turns the gun on herself. Her hand
starts shaking. She exhales sharply, twice, her body seizes up and she collapses on the floor.
Truman rushes to her.
TRUMAN
Josie? Josie!
(he turns to Cooper)
She's dead.
Cooper looks at them and senses something more:
 COOPER'S POV

CUT TO:

Josie and Truman disappear. A bright light appears in the room. In a hole in that light
Cooper sees the Little Man from his dream, dancing by, then replaced by the face of Bob,
laughing demonically. That image fades... Truman reappears, kneeling down, holding the
body of Josie. Cooper continues to watch-them, trying to make sense of what he's seen.
CUT TO:

 ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA drifts over to a chest of drawers, settling on a circular drawer pull. The grain of
the wood seems to waver momentarily and shift and in it we see the tortured, screaming
features of Josie.
CUT TO BLACK:
THE END



ACT ONE
FADE IN:


EXT. BOOKHOUSE - DAY
Establish.



INT. BOOKHOUSE
OPEN ON TRUMAN sitting at a table in the bookshelved alcove. Playing from the bar
area, we HEAR Muddy Waters, I Just Want to Make Love to You. Truman is sleepless and
unshaven; his thoughts also appear to be growing a little wild. Before him is a half-empty
bottle of Canadian whiskey and an overturned, unused shot glass, which Truman lazily twirls.
HAWK enters carrying a box which he places in front the sheriff. He opens the box: it's a
packed Diner breakfast. Truman looks up at Hawk indifferently.
HAWK
One of Norma's breakfasts. Made special.
TRUMAN
(pushing it aside, he takes a drink)
Maybe later.
Hawk says nothing, but his look lingers for a moment.
TRUMAN
How's things at the station?
HAWK
Earle's chess game is the big concern. Man has a poor sense
of recreation.
A brief beat. As these are his vacation days, the same could obviously be said of Truman.
HAWK
We're holding up. For now.
TRUMAN
Cooper can handle it.
(beat)
It's a pretty simple town. Used to be, anyway. Maybe
the world's just caught up to it.
And perhaps also to Truman. Hawk gives the sheriff a Bookhouse salute, and goes, his receding
bootsteps slowed by concern.
CUT TO:



OMITTED






INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
START ON an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as she enters the Double R carrying a small
suitcase. She looks about, tentative, then spots NORMA stepping into view.
Norma!

YOUNG WOMAN

NORMA
(sees her, brightens)
Annie ...
It's Norma's sister, ANNIE BLACKBURNE. Norma comes around the counter to offer a
welcoming embrace. Annie receives it with relief, some hesitation. She's got a lot on her
mind. SHELLY comes out from the kitchen, carrying an order.
NORMA
Shelly, this is my sister, Annie.
SHELLY
Welcome, Annie. Norma's told me all about you.
Shelly, with an order in hand, spins away. Annie looks at her sister.
ANNIE
(a rueful smile)
All ... about me?
NORMA
Shelly's like family.
ANNIE
With our family that's not exactly a character reference.
NORMA
(gets the idea)
How did you and mom get along?
ANNIE
We can talk about her, or we can feel good about things.
I vote for plan B.
NORMA
Me, too. I'm glad you're here.
ANNIE
Feels a little strange. The real world. Little things.
Like I'd almost forgotten how to use money. Closest
we'd get in the convent was bingo chips.
(severe)
No charity, Norma. Promise.












NORMA
(smiles)
I'll work you 'till you drop.

CAMERA DRIFTS OVER to Shelly, who's just lowered the special in front of her customer,
MAJOR BRIGGS, and has waited a moment for him to sample.
(nods)
Compelling.

BRIGGS

Reasonably satisfied this isn't a complaint, she tentatively smiles and moves away. The LOG
LADY enters, passing behind Briggs at the counter and slowing to sit next to him. She then
suddenly stops behind the Major, staring down into his neck.


LOG LADY'S POV - BRIGGS
On the back of his neck, just above the high military collar, is a strange small marking,
consisting of three joined inverted triangles.
The Log Lady stares at the marking for a long beat. Then, as if touching some ancient rune,
reaches out, places two fingers upon it. Major Briggs feels her touch, swivels to face her.



INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

DALE COOPER, in full deputy dress, sits at Truman's desk, looking over several piles of
paperwork. At a corner of the desk is a copy of the Twin Peaks Gazette, opened to the
Personals section. Hawk enters.
HAWK
Harry's about to hit bottom.
COOPER
Is he eating?
(Hawk shakes his head)
His vacation days'll be used up soon. Think he'll come
back to work?
HAWK
Guess we'll find out. Give you a hand?
COOPER
That's a question I should be asking you.
HAWK
You're the senior lawman, Cooper. Let's let the rain fall
as it has been.
(eyeing the desk)
Besides. I hate paperwork.








COOPER
This is worse than the bureau, all the international
documentation. Eckhardt... Josie...
(reaches for a folder)
Have you seen Doc Hayward's autopsy on her? Says he
couldn't determine cause of death. And the body
weighed sixty-five pounds.
HAWK
How is that possible?
COOPER
I don't know. Maybe something to do with what I saw in
the room when she died.
HAWK
Maybe we'd better just whistle on our way past the
graveyard.
Yeah.

COOPER

HAWK
Anything on Earle?
COOPER
That trail's completely cold.
(grimly)
We'll have to wait for his response.


INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

Hectic preparations for tonight's fashion show benefit for Stop Ghostwood. Amidst the
workers still building the runway, AUDREY HORNE rehearses and directs the models.
RICHARD TREMAYNE, the peacockish host, is accomplishing nothing outside of a skillful
job of smoking. He sidles up to a couple idle MODELS, who stand in requisite boredom,
awaiting further instructions, or romantic rescue.
TREMAYNE
Ladies, may I say you'll both delightfully represent the
sanctity of nature.
(the models just look at him)
Cigarette?
MODEL
I like to keep my chest clear.








TREMAYNE
(an excuse to look at same)
The Great God Fitness.
Audrey comes up to Tremayne, irritated by his utter uselessness.
AUDREY
Have you spoken with Pinkle?
TREMAYNE
What's a Pinkle?
AUDREY
He's going to give a talk on the Pine Weasel.
(blank)
The endangered animal.
TREMAYNE
Oh. Lovely. What is it? A raccoon or something?
AUDREY
A ferret.
(looking out)
There he is.
TIM PINKLE, of Tim and Tom's Taxidermy approaches, carrying a large stuffed Pine
Weasel under one arm. His plaid jacket looks almost like a taxidermy that didn't take.
AUDREY
You two should coordinate.
TREMAYNE
You are dreaming.
Audrey turns away and runs straight into JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER. She is momentarily,
uncharacteristically, schoolgirlishly flustered.
WHEELER
Hello, Audrey.
(gazing about)
You look like you're trying to run lumber upstream.
AUDREY
(seeking safer terrain)
How may I help you, Mr. Wheeler?
WHEELER
Well, I was thinking about our talk last night...








(2)
AUDREY
Oh gosh, I'm sorry, I was rude, wasn't I? It's just that
when it comes to family, I...
WHEELER
My fault entirely.
Audrey and Wheeler drift closer, casting sentences at each other.
AUDREY
...get a little excitable, that's all.
WHEELER
Who am I to waltz in here out of nowhere...
AUDREY
We need help, anyone can see that...
WHEELER
... as if your father didn't have enough help already....
AUDREY
... and I can't think of anyone better qualified for the job
than you...
Suddenly, Wheeler stops, removes himself from the back and forth. Audrey takes note, looks
up at him. Wheeler smiles.

Hello.

WHEELER

AUDREY
(a little dreamy)
What're we talking about anyway?
WHEELER
I was apologizing. You were apologizing. We're both
real sorry...
(new idea)
Do you ... want to go somewhere...?
(eying the pandemonium around them)
... this is probably not a good time...
AUDREY
Oh, no, it's great.





(3)



WHEELER
How about a picnic?
AUDREY
Well, we'll need outdoors stuff. A blanket, a basket...
Food.

WHEELER

AUDREY
I don't know how to cook.
WHEELER
I'll bet there's someone in the kitchen who does.
CAMERA PICKS UP Tremayne and Pinkle, passing by.
PINKLE
(proferring the stuffed animal)
It's just so people can see what a Pine Weasel looks like.
TRUMAN
I understand the concept perfectly, Mr. Twinkle.
PINKLE
Pinkle. The name is Pinkle.
TREMAYNE
But what I'm trying to make clear to you is that using a
stuffed animal to represent an endangered species at an
ecological protest constitutes the supreme incongruity.
PINKLE
Yeah, that's real clear, Dick...


INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

CUT TO:

OPEN ON a work desk on which sit three stainless steel suitcases. One of them, a makeup
case, is open. Propped against its standing half is the photograph of a bearded, bespectacled
young man with white bushy eyebrows. SOUND of an irregular wheeze of breathing: PAN
ACROSS THE ROOM to where LEO JOHNSON awkwardly reaches down into a closet,
emerging with... Windom Earle's slippers. One in each hand. He shuffles into the living room,
up to the easy chair where Windom sits.
Slip...
Slippers.

LEO
WINDOM








Earle's tone makes Leo look up suddenly, anticipating a shock. But none is coming. SHOT
CLOSES ON Earle as we hear Leo moving away.
EARLE
You know Leo, you really can't appreciate how tonic
country life is until you're actually right here living it.
A concurring GRUNT from OFF SCREEN. Leo approaches again, carrying Earle's pipe.
Pipe...

LEO

EARLE
Splendid.
(takes the pipe; Leo goes)
Even if you've been in the country before, when you
imagine what it would be like to go back... the image is
imperfect. The mental image is always imperfect. Am
I right?
Leo arrives again with the day's paper, flinching at Earle's look.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Tacit agreement is acceptable, Leo. Your silence speaks
volumes.
(takes the paper and opens it)
Or if not volumes at least the occasional, unpunctuated
paragraph.
Leo sits on a small crate purposely positioned at Earle's right hand. Leo's spot.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Let's see what move our poor Cooper's come up with this
time...
After finding the chess move, Earle's eyes stay on the page a beat. He then leans over to the
chess board on his other side and makes the communicated move. A long survey of the board.
Looks up with great displeasure. Leo gazes at him as we might an overcast sky.
EARLE (CONT'D)
This isn't a move. This is a trick.
(gazing at Leo)
He's playing a stalemate game.
(Leo's confused return stare)
Cooper doesn't know the meaning of stalemate...
(cool fury)
He's getting help.
Earle reaches for his Samurai flute. Leo knows it isn't to play: this is not a musical moment.
CLOSE ON the flute, held high and swaying in the air.









(2)
EARLE (CONT'D)
I have no tolerance for people who don't play by the rules.
People who shirk the standards.
The flute comes crashing down on Leo's head. He wimpers in discomfort.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Many people are going to regret this.
He lifts the flute again. Leo cowers. But Earle merely raises it to his mouth. And plays.
CLOSE ON a glistening emerald ring on Earle's left hand. THEN PULL BACK, framing
this little domestic tableau.
FADE OUT:

END ACT ONE





ACT TWO
FADE IN:


INT. BOOKHOUSE - DAY
OPEN ON Truman, looking pretty much as before. His breakfast hasn't been touched. His
whiskey has. He continues to fiddle with the empty shot glass. Cooper enters, taking in the
whole scene with a glance; he sits down across from Truman.
Coop.

TRUMAN

COOPER
Harry.
(sits)
We got Josie's dossier in from INTERPOL.
TRUMAN
More good news.
COOPER
In addition to her killing Eckhardt, trying to kill me and
killing Jonathan in Seattle...
Closed cases.

TRUMAN

COOPER
She's also been a wanted for a variety of felonies in Hong
Kong.
TRUMAN
I don't need to hear this.
COOPER
She also had two prostitution arrests...
Truman turns away in despair.
COOPER
Harry, eventually it'll help for you to know she was a
hardened criminal. A killer.
Get out.

TRUMAN

COOPER
I know it's not easy now 








Go.

TRUMAN
(gets up)

Cooper stands, gives his friend a long look and walks slowly out of the Bookhouse.
 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE

CUT TO:

CATHERINE sits at her desk, pores over blueprints and documents. Plans for the new and
improved Ghostwood development. She hears a faint rustling sound, looks up ... and sees
JONES standing across the room.
JONES
The door was open.
CATHERINE
(cool and calm)
A country habit. We're all so trusting.
JONES
My name is Jones, I was exec executive assistant to the late Mr.
Eckhardt.
Catherine gestures to a chair, carefully watches her guest take a seat. Jones has a satchel purse,
which Catherine is also watching.
JONES
Thank you. I've come to expedite the transport of his
body back to Hong Kong.
(Catherine says nothing: what does this woman
want?)
Tragic, what happened. You know, he really did love
Josie.
CATHERINE
(inimitably)
Didn't we all.
JONES
They're going to be buried side by side...
CATHERINE
So they can keep an eye on each other.
JONES
I guess you have your reasons to be bitter.






 
CATHERINE
Call me a healthy skeptic.

Catherine raises her hand above the desk, reveals the gun she's been holding since she discovered
Jones in her living room.
CATHERINE
Now, what did you really come here to see me about?
JONES
I came here to give you a gift.
(motioning to her purse)
May I?
CATHERINE
I don't think so.
(motioning)
Empty it.
Jones complies, emptying her large purse onto the couch beside her. Out fall no guns or
weapons of any kind, just women 's minutiae, save one very mysterious looking black box.
Jones picks it up and hands it to Catherine.
JONES
From Thomas.
Catherine gazes at it, puzzled. Jones scoops her belongings back into the purse and rises to her
feet, Catherine lowers the gun barrel.
JONES
I have a few things to tidy up, then I'll be leaving tonight.
(warmly)
Good luck, Mrs. Martell.
We HEAR her going as the SHOT CLOSES on the black gift box.
 INT. HAYWARD HOUSE

CUT TO:

Donna sits in the front room over a cup of coffee and a copy of the Gazette. The DOORBELL
sounds. At the door is a vaguely familiar man with a close light beard, spectacles and thick,
snowy eyebrows. We RECOGNIZE his face from the photograph in Earle's cabin.
MAN
Excuse me. I'm looking for Bill or Eileen Hayward.
DONNA
They're not in. Can I help you?


 


MAN
I'm Dr. Gerald Craig, a friend of Will's from medical
school. I've got a convention over in Spokane, and I
thought I'd swing by and surprise them. Now, which
daughter are you?
DONNA
I'm Donna.
(pause)
Would you like to come in, Dr. Craig?
CRAIG
I'd appreciate that.

They enter the living room, toward the perpendicularity of couch and chair.
DONNA
Would you like some coffee?
CRAIG
Thank you, no.
(sits, sees the Gazette)
Is this your local paper?
DONNA
Yes. It's a pretty small town.
Craig is stealing a glance at her, and various details of the room.
CRAIG
Don't knock small towns, till you've lived in a city
Donna. Looks to me like Will's found himself a little
piece of heaven here.
(beat)
Now, don't you have two sisters?
DONNA
Yes. They're younger.
CRAIG
(simply)
Are they both as beautiful as you?
DONNA
Well I don't really CRAIG
Funny. Your dad and I used to sit around, try to figure
how our lives would turn out. Think he came closer to the
mark than I have.





 (2)





CRAIG 
(self-deprecating laugh)
You're in high school?
DONNA
Unfortunately.
CRAIG
I felt exactly the same way. High school's difficult; you
have no idea what you want to do with your life, so it
seems as if almost none of it applies to your life.
DONNA
(impressed)
That's right.
CRAIG
Trust me, it'll make sense later. For now, just enjoy it.
In all its absurdity.

Donna is visibly refreshed to hear so something from an adult that sounds so life-accurate.
CRAIG
I have a small gift for your dad. Can I trust you not to
open it?

Sure.

DONNA
(intrigued)

Craig pulls a small, wrapped box from his pocket.
CRAIG
Speaking of school. Will and I graduated thirty years
ago, this month. This is a small remembrance for him.
He hands it to her. With the box is a piece of paper.
CRAIG
(re the paper)
I should be on my way. That's the number where I'm
staying.
(stands)
Hope to see you later, Donna.
Me, too.

DONNA

She looks at this little package with fascination. As he ambles off, we HEAR Craig begin to
whistle: we RECOGNIZE this as the piece Earle was playing on his Samurai flute.
CUT TO:





 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Encamped in one growing corner of the room is PETE MARTELL, surrounded by chess
boards, chess books, coffee, lined tablets on which he's made notations specific enough to
embarrass some field generals of actual wars. Cooper enters.
COOPER
Pete, how are we doing?
Martell looks up. Another face in need of sleep.
PETE
Never had to look at a chess board like it's a bunch of
actual human beings. Makes for some nasty dreams.
(beat)
I've been through every stalemate in recorded history, and
I've jerryrigged a few country standoffs they've written no
books about. But it's no use: there isn't a stalemate game
on earth where you don't lose at least a few footsoldiers.
(sighs)
The classic Herbstman leaves you with six pieces. Now I
can improve on that, but even if I get there in half the
time and keep twelve, that means six people will die.
COOPER
Do your best, Pete. Windom Earle's genius carries with it
the vice of impatientence. He doesn't want to kill eight
pawns. He wants royalty. Protect those, particularly the
queen, and we can frustrate him.
WOMAN (O.S.)
You can't do that.
PETE
(to Cooper)
My students.
In another corner of the room, LUCY and ANDY sit across a chess board, clearly at
loggerheads.
LUCY
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight but he didn't do the
little hook thing.
ANDY
You don't have to do the little hook thing. That's
optional.
PETE
Andy ... the knight has to do the little hook thing.



 
Every time?



ANDY

PETE
It's a privilege. No one else gets to make that move.
ANDY
Okay, Mr. Martell...
Lucy looks on at her opponent with indignant superiority.
LUCY
I guess some people don't know quite as much as they
think they do...
(moves)
Check.
Brennan stares at the board. Cooper turns to see he has visitors.
BRIGG'S VOICE
We thought it best we come see you.
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

CUT TO:

ANGLE ON the blackboard, on which are drawn three inverted triangles. PULL BACK to
Cooper, Briggs and the Log Lady.
BRIGGS
As you know, that pattern on the back of my neck
appeared during ... my experience. With of course no
idea as to how it got there.
COOPER
(to the Log Lady)
And you noticed it today.
LOG LADY
My log noticed. I remember.
Remember?

COOPER

LOG LADY
Look at the back of my leg.
 INSERT - HER LEG
Behind the knee is the figure of a square with an 'x' inside, creating four triangles.
DISSOLVE TO:






 
BLACKBOARD
Where Cooper has drawn this image on the board, beside the inverted triangles of Briggs:
LOG LADY (V.O.)
I was seven years old. I went walking up in the woods
and when I got back, I was told I'd disappeared for a
day. All I could recall was a flash of light ... and that
mark was on my leg.
BACK TO SCENE
BRIGGS
We all three recall the light.
LOG LADY
And also... the sound of an owl...
COOPER
I remember that.
LOG LADY
The only other other time I saw that sight and heard that
sound... was just before my husband died.
Cooper is staring at the board. He steps up to the square of four triangles and draws Briggs's
three smaller inverted triangles inside them creating another shape which immediately
excites Briggs and the Log Lady.
BRIGGS
I've seen that before.
Yes...

LOG LADY

Cooper turns to them excitedly.
What is it?

COOPER

Something about this figure is visibly upsetting to them both. Briggs looks at Cooper and just
shakes his head. The Log Lady hunkers down with her log, for security and insight, and finally
looks up, dismayed.
LOG LADY
I don't know...
CLOSE ON the blackboard's symbol.
CUT TO:



 EXT. WOODS - DAY




OPEN ON a wooded vista, some hidden spot in the verdent forest. We HEAR a man's voice,
singing clear as a bell, 0 Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie. CAMERA MOVES between the
pines to REVEAL Audrey and John Wheeler seated upon a blanket, a picnic lunch between
them, Wheeler singing his cowboy song. Audrey watches, jawdropped, she couldn't be more
surprised ... or taken with this handsome stranger. Wheeler finishes, peers at her. For once in her
life Audrey Horne is speechless. Finally:
Wow.

AUDREY

Wheeler says nothing, waits for her. Audrey, suddenly vulnerable, without the usual banter to
protect her, finally continues:
AUDREY
Nobody's ever sung a song to me before.
WHEELER
You must've been serenaded a time or two.
AUDREY (not coy)
I don't inspire a lot of singing. Most boys are afraid.
Wolf whistles, maybe.
WHEELER
(appreciating the revelation)
They don't know you then. Not really.
He's right. Audrey's been waiting a long time for someone to discover her secrets. She's
delighted, though not sure what to say. Wheeler interprets her silence as rebuke.
WHEELER
Sorry for being forward. It's not I like I know you that
well. In fact I don't know you at all.
(to self as well as Audrey)
Charm is a rocky road...
(quiet humor)
Another cowboy song, I know, a shot...?
AUDREY
(with an affectionate smile)
I'm completely tone deaf.
Now it's his turn to be discomfited. A beat. Both realizing that the other fills them with a
sort of uncertain warmth, the awkwardness that accompanies sudden infatuation, or love.
Wheeler reaches for a bottle of beer, changes the subject.
WHEELER
(quiet, contemplative)
Flying out here, I took a big northern swing. It's
beautiful. The air and light up toward the pole is like





 




WHEELER 
nothing you've ever seen. You sort of float while the earth
turns underneath. And the northern light gets trapped on
the horizon, in this bright blue band. Frozen light.
Frozen color.
Wheeler looks at her. Audrey pauses, preoccupied; then returns to the heart of the matter.
AUDREY
I don't think anyone really knows me.
WHEELER
That sounds like a warning.
AUDREY
(faint hesitation)
I know.
WHEELER
(considerate as always)
Audrey. If there's some other guy, I'll...
AUDREY
There used to be, but...
A long beat. Audrey thinking about Cooper, first love, then, at last...
AUDREY (warm and certain)
No. There's not. There's nobody.
WHEELER
So what'll we do now?
AUDREY (with humor)
Know any more cowboy tricks?
WHEELER (in kind)
If you've got a lariat in that picnic basket, I could lasso
passing cattle.
AUDREY
The closest cow is miles from here.
WHEELER
Well. Stray dogs, raccoons, a bluebird ... anything you
want...
HOLD ON Jack and Audrey for a beat. Falling in love. FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO


ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 INT. HAYWARD'S LIVING ROOM. - DAY
DOC and EILEEN HAYWARD enter, Doc pushing her in the wheelchair. Donna enters from
a back room.
DONNA
You two had a visitor.
Who's that?

HAYWARD

DONNA
Somebody you went to medical school with. Gerald
Craig?
Hayward reacts with visible surprise. Eileen pales.
DOC HAYWARD
Gerald Craig? That's impossible, Donna.
DONNA
He's on his way to convention in Spokane. He knew all
about me and...
(remembers phone numbers)
He left a phone number. And this.
Donna hands her father the wrapped package , Craig's phone number. Hayward, still silent,
stunned, hands the number to Eileen, begins to open the package
HAYWARD
Gerry Craig was my roommate, he ... he drowned during a
rafting trip on the Snake River. I was there, Donna, I
tried to save him, but...
DONNA
(chilled)
Then who was ...?
Eileen turns to both from the phone, she's just dialed the number Donna gave them.
EILEEN
It's a cemetary.
Doc takes the lid off the gift box.
 INSERT - THE OPENED BOX
contains a beautiful black hand-carved chess piece. A knight. The piece of paper below it










 
reads "Kn to KB3".
BACK TO SCENE
HAYWARD
Knight to King's Bishop 
DONNA
What is it, dad?
HAYWARD
That man, he's ... he's very dangerous. Don't let him in
here again, do you understand?
Sure -

DONNA

HAYWARD
I've got to take this over to Cooper.
He gathers up the box, chess piece and paper, then exits.
EILEEN
(distracted)
Donna give me your father's yearbook. It's upstairs, in the
study ...
Donna nods assent. WE FOLLOW her out of the room and up the stairs. From far away, WE
HEAR the DOORBELL.
I'll get it

EILEEN

Fearing this might again be the impostor, Donna starts down the stairs, but only gets a couple
beats down...
 DONNA'S POV
looking down over the stairway, into the front alcove. Eileen leans forward in her wheelchair
to unlock the door. A MAN immediately steps inside. It is Ben Horne. He drops to one
knee and speaks to Eileen in urgent, hushed tones. We cannot HEAR what is being said.
 INT. HURLEY LIVING ROOM DAY

CUT TO:

Ed and NADINE sit body-width apart on the couch. DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY sits in a
facing chair.



 



ED
Nadine, what I'm really here to say to you is...
(a look to Jacoby, who gazes back with cool
encouragement)
... seeing as how you're with Mike now...
NADINE
It's so cute the way you get embarrassed.

Ed gathers himself. This is not easy. Despite the absurdity of it, this is still, after all, his
wife; and someone he's been with since high school.
ED
And since I've found someone else ... Nadine, I'm not sure
you're going to understand this.
NADINE
Course I understand, Eddie. This isn't just a little spat.
JACOBY
Do you know what Ed is suggesting?
NADINE
It's not too obvious. We're not like talking relativity
here. We're breaking up. Major, final breakup.
Ed and Jacoby trade looks.
JACOBY
Well, yes, technically it is a breakup, Nadine...
ED
But it's a little more than that, too, honey.
NADINE
Ed, you're so serious. These are the dating years. You're
acting like it's some really big deal.

Doc ...

ED
(pause, aside)

JACOBY
(stage whisper)
There aren't any secret tricks or magic words. It's like
the dissolving of scar tissue around a wound: she'll start
to see reality again when her mind begins to feel safe.
ED
When will that be?




JACOBY
Can't say. That tissue's packed in there pretty hard.
NADINE
Okay, well one thing I don't want to see, Ed, are any
incidents with Mike. No jealous rages.
(a wink)
Well... maybe just a little one.
I give up.

ED

JACOBY
Nadine. You and Ed are about to get a divorce.
Nadine stares at Jacoby. Her expression goes from incomprehension to discomfort to fear.
Suddenly she closes her good right eye. Opens it.
NADINE
I think I've gone blind in my left eye.
It's the eye with the patch. Ed and Jacoby again trade looks, they are both bankrupt of
responses.
CUT TO:
 INT. DINER
OPEN ON Norma looking at a FLYER for the Miss Twin Peaks contest. She then carries it
over to Shelly at the counter.
NORMA
Shelly, have you seen this?
SHELLY
"Miss Twin Peaks."
(looks it her, realizes what she's suggesting)
Me? Are you kidding?
NORMA
There's a cash prize, a college scholarship ... I'll bet you
could walk away with it.
SHELLY
I don't know, Norma.
NORMA
It's easy. Give a speech, answer a couple questions...
SHELLY
(as pageant host, using fork for mike)
Miss Double R Diner, how would you bring about world








 
peace?

SHELLY 

(as vapid contestant)
Well. I would ask all world's leaders to form a circle
and hold hands. Because you can't make a fist if you're
busy holding hands.
NORMA (deadpan)
You're a shoe-in.
SHELLY (in kind)
I've got an order up.
Shelly, to Norma's amusement, sashays to the kitchen window and vamps the order over to her
customer, a dark-haired man who looks like a highway gypsy, possibly a trucker.
MAN
What's with the little dance?
SHELLY
Oh, my boss was telling me I should enter this contest.
(self-deprecating scoff)
Miss Twin Peaks.
As she lowers his order, we see the EMERALD RING of Windom Earle.
MAN (EARLE)
You can kid about it, but you're very pretty. I think you
should enter.
SHELLY
Thank you. I never think of myself as pretty.
Shelly muses as she walks away. Over her shoulder we watch Cooper enter and take a counter
seat on the side opposite Earle, and further down. We CLOSE ON Cooper.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Are you ready to order?
He looks up at this unfamiliar voice and freezes on Annie Blackburne's face. There is instant,
mutual attraction. Something close to love at first sight. Cooper is hooked by Annie's soft
features - Botticcelli's Venus serving coffee. Annie feels it too, but is far less comfortable with
it.
COOPER
A cup of deep, black joe.
ANNIE (lays out silverware)
Coming right up.




 (2)



COOPER
You're a new face.
ANNIE
I'm Annie. Norma's sister.
COOPER
Dale Cooper. Local law enforcement.
ANNIE
Must keep you pretty busy
COOPER
It does. But in this town, there's always time to sit a
while and absorb ... observe.
(beat)
Are you staying in town ... awhile?
ANNIE
I might be here quite a while
COOPER
It's happened to me.
ANNIE
Looks like it's grown on you.
COOPER
Things have a way of doing that here.

She starts to speak, then self-consciously backs off, sloe-eyed, half-smiling.
 POV - THE MAN (WINDOM EARLE)
stares over at Cooper speaking to Annie. Studying him.
BACK TO SCENE
As Annie serves his coffee, her longsleeved shirt rides up far enough for Cooper to spot the
beginning of extensive wrist scars. He knows what they mean.
ANNIE
I made it a little strong.
COOPER
You made it right.
Cooper gets an odd feeling, and suddenly looks across the counter: Earle is gone. Hawk
enters, making a straight line for Coop.


 






HAWK
We've got a problem at the Bookhouse.
CUT TO:

 INT. BOOKHOUSE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Dark, ominous. Standing beside the door is Andy.
ANDY
Agent Cooper, Hawk, the Sheriff's gone off. He's broken
every piece of furniture that's not nailed down and shot
out the ceiling lights. I honestly don't know what to do.
HAWK
It's okay, Andy.

He is clearly frightened. Cooper and Hawk follow a trail of broken furniture. Truman sits in
darkness, a bottle of Jack Daniels beside him, gun in hand.
TRUMAN
Hello, Coop. How's business?
COOPER
A little complicated at the moment.
TRUMAN
Nice thing about the law. It doesn't breathe.
(eyes his gun)
You can't kill it.
COOPER
Harry, let's make this simple ... why don't you hand me
that gun.
TRUMAN
Don't think I've handed my gun over to anybody my
entire life.
COOPER
This might be the time.
TRUMAN
You know something else I've never done? I've never
really left Twin Peaks. Ever. Never crossed the ocean. I
was the one who stayed. Then Josie came to town. And
my life...
(quietly hopeless)
My life was different. It was better. And now she's
gone...




 




COOPER
(gently)
Your life belongs to you, Harry. Josie didn't take it with
her.
TRUMAN
(lost in thought, regret)
When I walked in that room... and it looked like I might
have to shoot her...
(beat)
I know she lied. I know she was evil.
(beat)
I looked into her eyes... and watched the life drain out of
them... she was...
(breaking harder)
... so helpless... she needed me and there was nothing I
could do...
With that, Truman completely unravels, knocking over the bottle.
TRUMAN
It didn't have to end like that... she didn't have to die...
The gun's aim swings into wider, more dangerous circles. Cooper steps in, pulls Truman into
a bearhug. Truman grabs onto him, finally allowing himself some comfort.
Easy.

COOPER

The sheriff's arms extend despondently, the gun dangling from his hand. Hawk takes it.
TRUMAN
There's so much I don't understand...
COOPER
We're all like that, Harry.
CLOSE ON the spilled bottle of Jack Daniels, its copper puddle, seen between rungs of a
busted chair.

ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 INT. BOOKHOUSE - EARLY NIGHT
Cooper and Hawk carry Truman in, dropping him lightly down on the bed. They step over
toward the table lamp, as Truman lies in the darker background.
COOPER
Somebody keep an eye on him tonight.
HAWK
(beat, looks down at him)
Never seen him that way. It was like hiking out to a
favorite spot and finding a hole where the lake used to be.
(beat)
Josie had power.
COOPER
"A man who doesn't love easily, loves too much."
(looking down at Truman)
A good man.
The best.

HAWK

A beat. Truman rustles slightly.
TRUMAN
(through his sleep)
Keep going....
Cooper and Hawk look over at the inert sheriff, then at each other.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - LOBBY

CUT TO:

OPEN ON several couples in evening dress, heading for this evening's Ghostwood benefit.
CLOSE ON the registration desk, where concierge RICHARD LAZARE, is registering an
odd-looking YOUNG COUPLE, with one obviously empty suitcase.
LAZARE
That's a special honeymoon suite for .. Mr. and Mrs...
Hinkman?
EXPAND to reveal the 'Hinkmans': Nadine in a topcoat, summer hat and dark glasses.
Wearing his prom suit and an extremely nervous expression is MIKE NELSON.
MIKE
(near to babbling)
That's... correct. We're from Bozeman originally, but my



 





MIKE 
wife thought it would be nice to see the countryside, and
you know, there's some pretty nice country here in Twin
Peaks...
LAZARE
(dryly)
Will you be with us long?
NADINE
(bubbling)
Not long enough..
MIKE
Only until tomorrow. If that's okay. We're going deep
sea fishing.
NADINE
(orgasmically enthusiastic)
Oh goody.
MIKE
Okay, so we'll just go now. Me and Mrs. Hinkman.

Two of the Ghostwood benefit models pass by. Young girls, about high school age. One of
them slows at the sight of the registering couple.
MODEL
Is that ... Mike?
Mike cringes. Nadine, through shades and an eye patch, stares knives at this girl, who is
thinking her buddy Mike must have lost a bet.
MIKE
How are you, Susan?
Fine.

MODEL

(giggles)
See you in school...
Lazare looks askance at this. Nadine simmers. Mike feels her iron grip tighten further.
NADINE
The room, please.
For emphasis, Nadine impatiently SLAMS the desk bell. The clerk stares down at the
counter. The bell is flattened. Mike smiles weakly, lifting the empty suitcase.
MIKE
I think we can handle the bags.

CUT TO:


 INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM
The Stop Ghostwood benefit has drawn a large, black tie crowd. BEN HORNE stands at the
microphone, located off on a wing of the newly constructed runway.
BEN
I'd first like to thank you all for this marvelous turnout.
It's gratifying to see so many people who are serious
about their environment.
(beat)
The Stop Ghostwood campaign is a determined effort to
keep the rabid development interests from trying to turn
our beautiful northwest forests into a monstrous
amusement park, destroying animal preserves that have
been undisturbed for centuries, the little worlds which
serve as sanctums for several endangered species.
Before moving along, I'd just like to remind us all that
ecology is not a luxury science, and it's not about pleasant
appearances: it's about survival. About whether we're all
going to make it. Period.
(beat)
But on the other hand, not to understate the value of visual
splendor, we come now to our fashion show. If you think
you recognize some of our models, it's because they're
concerned members of our community who have
graciously contributed their time tonight. So, ladies and
gentlemen, to kick things off, our host Richard
Tremayne.
Tremayne approaches the mike to scattered applause, grinning up past his eyebrows.
TREMAYNE
Thank you. Splendid gathering.
We DROP to a LONG SHOT of the runway, FAVORING the models as they emerge. The
first striding figure is Lucy Moran, cautiously eying Tremayne as she walks uncertainly out
along the ramp.
TREMAYNE
Our little Lucy wears a delightful mix of warm northern
comfort and southern insouciance. An elegant worsted
wool jacket over a sueded charmeuse T-shirt... fabulous,
isn't it?
Having nervously reached the end of the runway a little early, Lucy has to do a few too many
turns and starts to grow dizzy.
TREMAYNE
And a moonless-night-blue slim skirt of matching
worsted, for the look that always says, hey, world! I'm
here...






 



Lucy wobbles back toward the curtain. A pause. The next model, who looks more like he's
walking a plank than a runway, is Andy Brennan.
TREMAYNE
Mr. Brennan, a man for all seasons, is wearing a baby rib
wool turtleneck beneath a daring plaid all-wool
pendleton shirt.
Andy reaches the end of the ramp and freezes in stage fright, gawking out at the audience.
TREMAYNE
The look is completed by his black flaring cotton
trousers. For the man who wants to make a statement
while retaining the casual feel, whether he's out mastering
a task or riding the breeze of a chance meeting ...
(beat)
That'll do it, Andy.
With stiff hulklike movements, Andy turns and goes.
CUT TO:

 BACKSTAGE
Audrey hectically lines up the remaining models.

AUDREY
At this rate, were going to run late, so if you could all
sort of hurry Richard along with some quick movement
our there ...
Lucy walks past, still a little dazed, trailing Andy, the bright red turtleneck almost exploding
out of his shirt.
ANDY
I'm hot in this thing.
LUCY
You're hot? All this worsted? I'm dressed like a sheep.
(beat)
And I also think Mr. Tremayne's getting a little warm
himself, over all these girls...
(Andy's sour expression)
TREMAYNE (FAR O.S.)
Our next model....
Audrey gives the lead girl a tap.
Go!

AUDREY
CUT TO:





 THE BAR
Ben Horne sits over a drink, momentarily escaping the crowd. Catherine sits beside him.
CATHERINE
Well, if it isn't John Muir, friend of the redwood.
BEN
Catherine, dear, how good of you to come?
CATHERINE
Ben, darling, let me ask you; who are you kidding with all this?
BEN
Catherine, I am absolutely one hundred per cent sincere.
CATHERINE
Ben, look who you're talking to. We're in the same line of
work: you've always been a little more obvious, but this...
at least I use some imagination.
BEN
Catherine, have you ever in your entire life had an
experience that truly changed you.
CATHERINE
Spare me the Born Again sales pitch and level with me,
you can't really hope to stop development plans with
this little sideshow; what do you actually expect to gain
from all this?
BEN
A first scrubbing on one of the dirtiest consciences in the
entire Northwest.
(beat)
It'll happen to you, Catherine. I know what you're
planning with Ghostwood. And granted, I used to see
life exactly the way you do. And no matter how many
deals I closed, or much money I made, inside I was a
black, miserable clod of dirt. Catherine, the one thing
that really affords you joy in life, the only authentic
thing is giving. Darling, don't wait until you're on your
death bed to find that out.
CATHERINE
God help you. It sounds like you actually mean this.
BEN
I do mean it. For you, for me, and for the future.
(beat)








 
BEN 
Catherine, why not take this opportunity to transcend a
lifetime of megalomania and egocentricity...
(eye to eye)
... and write us a fat check to help stop Ghostwood?
CUT TO:

 RUNWAY STAGE

Standing beside Tremayne, much to Richard's disgust, is Tim Pinkle, attired in a cherry
sportcoat and pink polyester pants. Beside Pinkle is a cage, containing a meek-looking weasel.
TREMAYNE
And now, to introduce us to an endangered little critter
whose home is currently under attack by the proposed
Ghostwooddevelopment project ... Mr. Tim Pinkle.
PINKLE
Thanks, Dick. How's everybody doing tonight?
(nothing)
That's good.
In following the taller Tremayne, Pinkle loosens the stand in order to lower the mike, which
drops with a loud thud down to his ankle. In trying to extend it back up, he encounters more
resistance, gives it a good yank and shoots the mike up for someone six-eleven. Tremayne just
stares at him. Finally Pinkle lowers it to where it was originally.
PINKLE
Thank you. I'm here to introduce you all to a little guy
who doesn't understand the dark peril that awaits him.
An innocent in a world gone mad ...
Tremayne lightly elbows him, in a plea for brevity. Pinkie drops down and opens the cage.
PINKLE
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you ... the endangered Pine
Weasel.
Pinkle reaches down into the cage and pulls up the frightened animal, who is half-hypnotized
by the lights.
PINKLE
This species, technically of the weasel family, not only is
nonaggressive toward us humans and has beautiful fur ... he
is also by nature an excellent controller of rodents.
Pinkle holds the animal up in front of Tremayne.






 
PINKLE
Unfortunately the little fella is a very curious animal,
making him unusually easy to trap. He's particularly
drawn to ...
The weasel leans over toward Tremayne, sniffing.
PINKLE
... bright tinkling objects.
TREMAYNE
Must be my tie clasp.
PINKLE
And to various smells, particularly, believe it or not, very
cheap cologne ...
Ignoring this, Tremayne affectionately drops his head down toward the weasel, playing to the
audience. The little creature reaches up toward Tremayne.
PINKLE
Think he wants to give you a little kiss, Dick ...
TREMAYNE
(suppressing revulsion)
Hello there, little pilgrim.
The weasel lunges up sweetly and suddenly bites Tremayne on the nose. The host lets out a
yell, trying to pull himself away, but the animal won't let go. Tremayne finally wrenches
himself free, dancing up the runway in pain. The weasel screeches and bolts off the stage,
causing an immediate panic in the crowd. Women scurry around senselessly, screaming in fear.
PINKLE
No need to panic, folks ... he's completely harmless...
The place is in chaos. The weasel tears through the room, under a banquet table, spilling back
guests on both sides. Andy Brennan, still in costume, begins pursuit.
ANDY
Nobody panic!!......
Up on the stage, Audrey is out trying to restore order.
AUDREY
Please everyone, calm down... stay in your seats ...
From behind, an alarmed model knocks Audrey off the runway. She tumbles headlong ... into
the arms of Jack Justice Wheeler. And stays there.






 (2)
You alright?
Fine ...

WHEELER
AUDREY

WHEELER
Lot of fuss over a loose weasel.
AUDREY
Maybe we should help.
WHEELER
Oh, I don't know. Little excitement might do this crowd
some good.
They share a laugh as confused patrons knife by them. Audrey settles a little deeper into his
arms.
AUDREY
Did you come for the fashion show?
WHEELER
No. I came for you.
And with that, as the world falls apart all around them, Audrey and Wheeler share their first
passionate kiss. HOLD ON this tableau for a beat.

 INT. BOOKHOUSE

ANGLE ON a Bookhouse Boy, CAPPY, who sits guarding the door. Suddenly a GUN
BUTT cracks his head; he slides down onto the floor. The person who hit him, still faceless,
moves further inside.
 TRUMAN
is asleep in bed. The assailant walks up to him, holding the gun. A beat. The gun is then
placed on the nightstand.
The CAMERA PANS UP until we see it is Jones, still looking down at the sleeping Truman.
She now begins removing her clothes.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END



ACT ONE
FADE IN:


INT. BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT
Truman in a cot turns restlessly in his drunken sleep. He rolls over. A naked woman snuggles
close to him. In Truman's dreams it is Josie.
Josie -

TRUMAN

Truman kisses the woman who responds. It is JONES. She moves under the sheets.
Massaging. Whispers.
JONES
Do you like that?
TRUMAN
Yes, Josie. Yes.
Jones' hands slide under him - massaging. Then she rolls over on top of Truman who responds
with passion. The wheeze of the wire from the BRACELET GAROTTE wakes Truman. She
tightens the strangle line around his neck while she sits on top of him.
Jones bends over him and kisses him passionately. Truman uses this moment to flip her off
him. But at the same time Jones pulls the magnesium wire tighter. Truman fights to breathe
and free her hands from the garotte.
ANOTHER ANGLE



Truman manages to stand. Jones wraps her legs around him. Truman tears at her trying to get a
grip. Carrying her to a wall, Truman pounds her again and again against it. Jones is nearly
unconscious. Finally, her hands drop away from him. Truman keeps pounding, about to kill
her. Then stops himself. Looks down at the naked woman lying below him.
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTH
JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER pores over some books, maps, and in elaborate model for a
complicated irrigation system. A knock on the door.
FROM BEHIND THE DOOR
Room service.
It's open.

WHEELER

The door opens. Wheeler remains completely absorbed in what he is doing. Not noticing
that it is AUDREY HORNE who brings in his breakfast. Without looking up he retrieves a
money clip to give her a tip. Then notices it is Audrey. Surprised and pleased.






Audrey.




WHEELER

AUDREY (seductress relapse)
I trust your sleep was untroubled? Here at the Great
Northern, we aim to make your stay as comfortable and
enjoyable as we can - we take the concept of room
service very seriously Wheeler comes over to the bed, gently puts a finger to her lips to silence her.
WHEELER
Audrey ... did you know your grandfather?
(fingers still on her lips, becoming caress)
Colorful old guy, but the wisest man I've ever met. He
always used to say, "If you bring a hammer, you better
bring nails."
AUDREY (taking his fingers in hand)
What's that supposed to mean?
WHEELER
It means the next time you come into my room and sit
on my bed and carry on like this you had better be ready
to finish whatever it is you're trying to start.
AUDREY
Maybe I'm ready now.
WHEELER (simply)
Then be yourself.
AUDREY
This is myself.
WHEELER
You're a beautiful, intelligent, young woman. You don't
have to sneak in here and flirt like a high school girl.
Audrey fixes Wheeler with an challenging stare. Then:
AUDREY
(mimicking Wheeler)
"If you bring a hammer, you better bring nails."
(beat)
I'm not the only one who flirts.
WHEELER (beat, he smiles)
You're right. I stand corrected.

AUDREY
This could get confusing.
Why?

WHEELER

AUDREY (with humor)
Well, if I'm always worrying about being myself, and
you're always worrying, and I'm checking to see if you're
being yourself, but then you've got to keep an eye on you
too...
WHEELER
We'll be lucky if we can carry on a simple conversation.
Yep.

AUDREY (her point exactly)

WHEELER (beat, he moves closer)
Audrey, I have a plan. It involves a plane ride at sunset
and dinner for two.
AUDREY
What? When?
WHEELER
The sunset part or the dinner part?
AUDREY (she moves closer too)
I've got to go to the library, and my father wanted to
meet with me some time today WHEELER
If you're busy I'll understand...
AUDREY
Yes. I mean yes I'm busy. And yes I'll go.
They kiss.


INT. SHERIFFS STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM DAY

CUT TO:

Truman exits the room where Jones sits at the table, meets Cooper in the hallway.
Anything?

COOPER

TRUMAN
Not a word. Wants to speak to the South African
counsulate.









COOPER
My guess would be there's a half-dozen countries
looking to extradite her.
TRUMAN
Why would Eckhardt want me dead?
COOPER
Sexual jealousy.
TRUMAN
(as if he hadn't considered it)
Oh yeah.
COOPER
You think he needed a more rational reason? It's good
to have you back, Harry.
TRUMAN
(a hell of a hangover)
Take me a day or so to get my sea legs.
COOPER
To be honest, Harry you look like hell. Maybe you
ought to recuperate at home.
TRUMAN
All I need's some coffee and maybe some food.
Cooper stops him.
COOPER
Sure cure for a hangover, Harry. You start with a nearly
frozen, unstrained glass of tomato juice. Drop a couple
of oysters in there and chug it down. Breathe deeply.
Next a heaping mound of sauteed sweetbreads with
chestnuts and Canadian bacon. Finally some biscuits and
a bucket of gravy, and here's where it gets tricky, you're
gonna need some anchovies Truman, growing green, stops him outside the men's room door.
Excuse me.

TRUMAN

Truman rushes into the bathroom. Cooper, having acheived the desired stomach-pump effect,
gives a thumbs-up.
CUT TO:




INT. TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY




Cooper enters to find DOC HAYWARD admiring a BONSAI TREE that sits on Truman's
desk. A bow is wrapped around the base of the plant.
DOC
Multi-trunk bonsai. The ultimate miniature.
A shakey Truman enters a moment later, Cooper hands him a glass.
COOPER
Bicarbonate of soda.
TRUMAN
Thanks. Where'd this come from?
Truman takes the card from the plant. Reads it. Grows even paler.
COOPER
It was delivered this morning.
TRUMAN
It's from Josie.
Truman sits down trying to hold onto his composure. To Cooper, Doc indicates the package that
Windom Earle left at his house, which Cooper has already seen. Cooper gets the message: involve
Harry. He urges Doc to speak.
DOC
Harry, Windom Earle was at my house.
TRUMAN
Windom Earle was?
DOC
He left this with Donna.
Truman takes out a chess piece that is tagged with a chess move. It reads "Kn to KB"
Another note reads "Trying for a Stalemate?"
TRUMAN
What do we do?
COOPER
We've got to publish our next move today.
COLE'S VOICE
DALE COOPER, A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES IF EVER

SCHIZOID MANEUVERING.
Cooper stares at the next file. Flipping a page back and forth. Confused and fearful.
COOPER
"Project Blue Book." How could he have been working on that..?
COLE
WE LOANED HIM OUT TO THE AIR FORCE
IN ' REPORTS ON HIS TWO-YEAR HITCH
ARE BLACKED OUT. NATIONAL SECURITY.
TRUMAN (picking up on Cooper's concern)
Wait a minute, Earle was investigating UFO's?










Another worry for the group.
COOPER
Some curious linkages here, Gordon.
COLE
THE WORD LINKAGE REMINDS ME OF

Cooper reaches into the package. He takes out his BADGE, GUN, and CREDENTIALS.

EARLE
Good. Now find the king.
Leo picks another card and flips it over. A king is there with Cooper's face glued on it.
EARLE
And now we need one more Queen.
Earle picks out a Queen without a face.
EARLE
The Queen of Hearts.
He picks up a brochure for the MISS TWIN PEAKS CONTEST.
EARLE
Miss Twin Peaks. What do you get if you win. A
dozen roses, a college scholarship, the accolades of your

Say something else.
SHELLY
Would you like some pie with your coffee?
COLE
Good Lord, I can hear every word you say. This is

LOG LADY
My log thinks the cherry pie is a miracle as well.

Massive. Massive quantities. And a glass of water,
sweetheart, my socks are on fire.
COLE sits there with an absolute grin.
 COOPER AND TRUMAN

CUT TO:

ANNIE BLACKBURNE moves to the booth to take their order. They're staring out the
window. Annie does as well.



 




COOPER
(identifying)
Chickadee - sitting on a Dodge Dart.
TRUMAN
Think it's a finch - sitting on a Dodge Dart..
ANNIE
Nope. Chickadee. On a Dodge Dart.
Cooper turns back to see Annie smiling at him.
Hi.
Hi. Coffee?
For me.

COOPER
ANNIE
COOPER

TRUMAN
What's good for a hangover?
ANNIE
Teetotaling and prayer.
COOPER
(grins)
Good answer.
ANNIE
(good-humored)
Anyway, a cure might make you feel better and you're
supposed to suffer for your sins, remember?
TRUMAN
(lying)
That's a great comfort to me. I'll try coffee.
COOPER
How are you today?
ANNIE
I'm fine. Actually, I'm weird. I'm disoriented. I'm
not sure where I am exactly. I mean I know but it feels
odd, being here. I'm okay.



 (2)

Good.




COOPER
(uncertain)

ANNIE
Gosh, listen to me, I've been out of circulation so long
I've completely forgotten about social niceties. I mean,
you ask me how I am, I'm not really supposed to say how
I am, I'm supposed to say, "I'm fine, thanks, how are you?"
Cooper smiles. He likes her a lot and he can't hide it.
ANNIE
You must think I'm really strange.
Not at all.

COOPER

ANNIE
But I mean, with due consideration to the social niceties,
even if I asked you and you did think I was strange, you
wouldn't say so, would you?
COOPER
If I thought you were strange, I would tell you.
ANNIE
And you don't. Think so.
COOPER
Not for a second.
Truman's been watching this like a ping-pong match.
ANNIE
Okay. Good. Glad we cleared that up. So. What'll
you have?
TRUMAN
Chicken pot pie. And a glass of milk.
ANNIE
Good choice. All the major food groups represented.
COOPER
Turkey sandwhich. Whole wheat. Lettuce. A hair of
mayonaise. And I've got a joke for you: a couple of
penguins are walking across an iceberg and the first one




 (3)




COOPER 
says to the second, "You look like you're wearing a
tuxedo."
Annie?
I heard that.

SHELLY'S VOICE
COLE'S VOICE

ANNIE
Wait, I'll be right back.

Pause.

COOPER
I wasn't quite finished.
TRUMAN (his turn for prescience)
How long have you been in love with her?
COOPER
Who said anything about love?
TRUMAN
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.

Cooper is nailed. Maybe Truman's right. Not sure what to say. Annie comes back.
ANNIE
Okay, what did the second penguin say?
COOPER
(resuming with enthusiasm)
The first one says, "You look like you're wearing a
tuxedo." And the second one says, "Maybe I am."
TRUMAN
(after a millenium passes)
The defense rests.
ANNIE
That was cute.
Thank you.

COOPER

Pause. They look at each other. Annie realizes what she's doing, glances down at his napkin,
where Cooper's been doodling.
ANNIE
What are you drawing?








 (4)
Cooper looks down at his napkin.
CUT TO:

 NAPKIN
He's doodling the tattos on the Log Lady and Major Briggs.
RESUME SCENE
COOPER
Oh. Nothing. A couple of tattoos.
ANNIE
(a longer look)
Funny. Looks like the rocks in Owl Cave.

She moves off. Cooper watches her go, a little moonstruck. Another look at the napkin, then
Cooper snaps back on the beam.
COOPER
Owl Cave? What's Owl Cave?
TRUMAN
It's up near Pearl Lakes. Old Indian territory.
Supposed to be sacred ground. We used to go there
when we were kids.
(takes the napkin)
My God it does. It does look like it.
COOPER
(intuition pulsating)
Sounds like we better go there now.
They exchange a smile. Move in on the napkin.

ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
Donna steps through the living room, leafing through a handful of afternoon mail. She stops
suddenly, stares at a postcard, SAN FRANCISCO emblazoned across a rendering of the
Golden Gate bridge. Donna turns the card over, reads. We HEAR:
JAMES' VOICE
Dear Donna. You were right. I had to go. Everything
feels different when you're on the road. It feels better.
San Francisco is really cool. Next stop, Mexico. I'll be
back with a million stories. Promise. I love you, James.
Donna looks up, tearful. DOC HAYWARD enters the room, sees the postcard in her hands.
HAYWARD
James? How is he?
DONNA
He's good. He's doing what he needed to do.
Hayward putters with at the table. Donna watches him for a beat.
DONNA
Dad? Can I ask you something?
Sure.

HAYWARD

DONNA
How does Mom know Ben Horne?
Hayward tries to hide the jolt her question brings. He looks into his daughter's eyes, and lies.
HAYWARD
I doubt that she does, Donna. Not very well.
DONNA
(knows he's lying)
But he was over here yesterday. They were talking like
old friends.
HAYWARD
(compounding the lie)
Your mother works with the local charities. I'm sure
even Ben contributes once in a while.



 



DONNA
She drove to the Great Northern this morning. And she
saw him again.
HAYWARD
Probably something to do with a fundraiser ...
DONNA
I don't think so.
HAYWARD
... yes, that's it. Eileen mentioned it to me at breakfast.
One of those Heal The Planet things.
DONNA
She never said anything about it to me.
HAYWARD
(very firm, end of discussion)
Well that's exactly what it is. Your mother told me so.

Donna pauses, uncertain. Just then: the doorbell RINGS.
I'll get it.

DONNA

Donna steps to the door, off-screen. Hayward watches his daughter with evident concern.
When Donna returns, she holds a bouquet of flowers in her arms.
DONNA
They're for Mom. No card.
HOLD ON Donna for a beat. A blossom for every lie her father told her.
 INT. TWIN PEAKS CITY LIBRARY - DAY

CUT TO:

Audrey walks between dark library stacks, thinking about Wheeler, energized. She mounts a
short ladder, inspects a row of dusty books. She removes one, leafs through it, eyes seeking
pertinent information. Audrey begins to read, when ... SUDDENLY a footfall, Audrey looks
up. A man stands close by in the shadows. Startled, Audrey nearly tips the ladder. But the
quick-handed stranger grabs and steadies it.
STRANGER
Sorry. My fault.
AUDREY
It's okay. I didn't hear you coming...






 
STRANGER
One should never allow both mind and foot to wander at
the same time. Edward Perkins. Again, my apologies.
AUDREY
(pleased to meet a fellow seeker)
Audrey Horne. Pleased to meet you, Mister Perkins.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals that she is shaking the hand of Windom Earle. He is dressed as a
absent-minded academic. Trousers, shirt, cardigan sweater, wire-rim glasses. He eyes
Audrey closely throughout, just short of rudeness, as if measuring her for some future use.
EARLE
What brings you to the library?
AUDREY
Research. On civil disobedience.
EARLE
Good for you. It is incumbent on the young to disobey.
AUDREY
Are you a professor?
EARLE
I teach. Poetry is my area of expertise.
AUDREY
You're kidding. Someone sent me a poem. Wait.
She reaches into her jacket, pulls out the poem Windom sent to his three queens, now taped
together. She holds it out for him to inspect. But Earle quietly demurs.
You read it.

EARLE

AUDREY
(after a beat)
See the montains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another,
No sister flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea...
EARLE (interjecting)
What is this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?






 (2)
AUDREY
Yes ... you know it.
EARLE
Oh yes. Shelly.
Earle says it softly, wistful. He peers at Audrey with an intense expression. She wonders:
What ...?

AUDREY

EARLE
Gazing at you, perched on that ladder, reciting Shelly's
verse ... you look very much like a Queen.
AUDREY
(a little spooked)
Oh. Thanks. Well. I better go.
(descends, means to walk away)
Nice to meet you Mr. Perkins.
EARLE
(simply)
Perhaps we'll meet again someday.
Earle watches Audrey carry her book into the shadows.
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

CUT TO:

Cooper leads Andy and Hawk through the station. The deputies carry armloads of equipment
- safety helmets, flashlights, pick-axes and rope. LUCY MORAN sits at her post, watches
them pass. She sees Andy and sighs. He looks bold, dashing, ready for adventure.
Andy?

LUCY

Andy lingers. Cooper and Hawk continue to the Sheriff's office.
Yes, Lucy?

ANDY

LUCY
I want to thank you for helping out during the Weasel
Riot yesterday which is more than I can say for a certain
Dick we both know.






 
ANDY
(proud)
Keeping the peace is part of my job.
LUCY
Where are you going with all of that gear?
Spelunking.

ANDY

LUCY
Is it dangerous, spelunking?
Sometimes.

ANDY

LUCY
Promise me something?
Okay.

ANDY

LUCY
I know you'll be strong. And I know you'll be brave.
But I want you to promise me you'll be careful.
ANDY
(never more manly)
I'll be careful, Lucy. You have my word.
HOLD ON them for a beat. Love rekindled, or nearly so.
 INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

Truman peers down at the chess board as if to visualize the battle Cooper and Earle are
fighting there. He reaches out to touch a piece when the door to his office OPENS. Truman,
still suffering from a world class hangover, turns to face Cooper as he enters.
TRUMAN
Pete just called in our next move.
Truman hands a piece of paper to Cooper. Cooper reads it, steps to the board, moves the
appropriate piece. He considers the resulting formation.
COOPER
We expose a pawn to his bishop.



 



TRUMAN
Want me to hold off?
COOPER
No. If he takes the pawn he'll forfeit the bishop and
most of his initial advantage. Feeling any better, Harry?
TRUMAN
Like someone pounded a railroad spike into my ear.
COOPER
Then a descent into a cool, subteranean cave may be just
what the doctor ordered.

Cooper tosses the helmet to Truman. He catches it cleanly.
 EXT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

 INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

The diner is quiet, nearly empty. Annie cleans the counter, pauses to retrieve a flyer. It
reads: THE MISS TWIN PEAKS PAGEANT, our Twentieth Anniversary. Shelly steps into
view, reads it over Annie's shoulder.
SHELLY
Thinking of entering?
ANNIE
I think the real world's strange enough without getting up
on stage and parading around in a bathing suit and heels'
SHELLY
Guess they're not too big on that kind of stuff in the
convent.
ANNIE
That's a good guess.
SHELLY
Is it strange, you know, being back in civilization?
ANNIE
(a little defensive)
It wasn't as if they kept us locked up in the attic. We
had newspapers. We even had cable TV. Every time I
tell someone where I've been they act like I'm out on
parole.




 
Sorry.



SHELLY

ANNIE
(pause, an admission)
You know what's weird? Being around men again.
SHELLY
You don't have to spend time in a convent to feel that.
ANNIE
(pause, trying to sound idle)
What do you know about Agent Cooper?
SHELLY
(gentle teasing)
Are you interested?
ANNIE
(in kind)
It's like anthropology. Examing the native flora and
fauna. For educational purposes
Uh-huh.

SHELLY

ANNIE
So. Tell me about him.
NORMA
Okay. He's a few years older than you. Handsome, but
not too handsome. He's really, really smart. He's in the
FBI. He loves Twin Peaks. He loves pie and coffee.
And trees.
ANNIE
(deadpan)
Good. Now I won't have to send to Washington for his
file.
SHELLY
And judging from the look on his face when he saw you
today, I'd say you have a major opporunity.
ANNIE
Who said anything about that?
Shelly walks away, with a knowing smile.

ANNIE 
Sorry, you've got it wrong, I'm not even remotely
interested.

 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

Ben paces, taking bites from a carrot. Audrey, sits upon the office sofa, looks on with an
admiring smile.
BEN
Audrey, when Jack Kennedy entered the White House, he
took his brother with him, because he trusted Bobby to
tell him the truth even when it wasn't pretty. When the
Bay of Pigs went up in smoke, Bobby was there. When
the Russians moved missiles into Fidel's backyard,
Bobby helped his brother shoulder through.
AUDREY
Sort of like Jerry's been for you?
BEN
(moving closer)
The unvarnished truth is what I am looking for. I
believe you are the best man for the job.

Me?

AUDREY
(surprise and delight)

Ben kneels down before her, pauses. This is a new Ben. This comes straight from the heart.
BEN
Audrey, I haven't always been a good father to you. Oh,
hell, who am I kidding? When was I ever anything but a
sleazy rapacious heel?
AUDREY (moved)
Well. When I was little, maybe... I...
Audrey shrugs. Ben lived a life devoid of any and all goodness.
BEN
Exactly. But I've changed. And I'm determined to do





 



BEN 
better. To be the kind of father you'll respect some day.
I think about Laura. I think about the mistakes I've
made...
(this is hard for him)
I want to build a life in happiness. For the whole
family. Together.
(beat)
Won't you help me? Please?
AUDREY (through her tears)
Daddy, I'm your man.

A warm beat. Ben rises, beaming.
BEN
Sensational. Audrey, pack a bag get out to the
airport. Your plane leaves in an hour.
AUDREY
(from tears to confusion)
My plane?
BEN
(looking off)
John! Just the man I want to see.
John Wheeler pauses in the open doorway, enters. Audrey turns to meet his gaze, remembers
their plans for this evening. Her plane?!
Daddy, I...
Hello, Ben.

AUDREY
WHEELER

BEN
Audrey, you'd better get moving. One hour.
(to Wheeler)
Audrey's flying to Seattle tonight. She's having a
breakfast confab with the Sierra Club. We're going
national with this Pine Weasel thing.
AUDREY
I'm not sure I can leave on such short ...
BEN
(not listening, handing her a file)
Here are the particulars. Time, place, and so on. Bring








 (2)
BEN 
us back some good news.
AUDREY
(inspecting file, heart sinking)
Good news.
Audrey looks up. Her father beaming. Wheeler thinking about tonight. All the things they
cannot say to Ben just yet. Or to each other.
AUDREY
(collecting her thoughts)
I'd better go.
(glances at Wheeler, a helpless shrug)
Goodbye.
WHEELER
(sotto voce)
Goodbye.
Ben, unaware, wraps his daughter in a big farewell hug.
BEN
Bless you, Audrey. Safe passage.
Audrey takes one last look at Wheeler and walks out the door. A beat. And Ben slumps
down on the sofa with a mighty sigh.
WHEELER
What's wrong, Ben?
BEN
I am filled to the brim with goodness. Like a
Christmas tree all lit up inside me. But at the end of the
day, when I look in the mirror, I have to face the fact
that I don't really know how to be good.
WHEELER
(sitting down beside him)
You're off to a pretty fair start.
BEN
How do you do it, John? What's your secret? Can I learn
to be good too?
WHEELER
I don't see why not. Keep an eye on your heart. Always
tell the truth.






 (3)
BEN
(the concept is wondrous)
Always tell the truth.
WHEELER
Tell the hardest truth first.
BEN
Terrific. Tell the hardest truth first. I love that. jack,
this truth business is clearly at the forefront of goodness.
Ben ...
Yes, jack?

WHEELER
BEN

WHEELER
I'm falling in love with your daughter.
BEN
Now there's a hard truth.
WHEELER
It is the truth.
It is?
Yes.

BEN
WHEELER

A long beat. Ben pats Wheeler on the knee. Father to son.
BEN
(with kindness and approval)
Ahh, Jack. What a wonderful world we live in.
HOLD ON Ben and Wheeler for a beat. Side by side upon the sofa. Ben offers Wheeler a
carrot. Wheeler accepts.
FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:
 EXT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT
Two police vehicles parked in the dark, their lights shining brightly upon the rock formations
that enclose Owl Cave.
CUT TO:

 INT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT

START CLOSE on a pair of gloved hands desperately seeking purchase on a rocky wall.
Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. Encouraging voices are HEARD:
TRUMAN, COOPER, HAWK
That's it, Andy. Careful. One hand at a time.
CAMERA PULLS back to reveal Andy's head pressed against the wall, grimacing with effort,
and not a little afraid. He grunts, hand over hand, as Truman and the others shout instructions
from below. Then, finally, with one last moan ... Andy sinks out of frame like a stone.
Andy lands with a thud on the floor of Owl Cave. Flashlight beams criss-cross his features as
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk huddle about him
COOPER
Are you all right?
ANDY
(determined to be the man of action)
I'm fine.
They part, help Andy to his feet. And turn their lights on the interior of the cave. It is a large,
airy space filled with rocky outcroppings, strange shapes in the dark.
Incredible.

COOPER

As the beams of light trip across the cave walls, Hawk intones:
HAWK
We used to play here when I was a kid. Pretend it was
haunted by fierce ghosts.
Truman kicks something in the dark, picks it up. A beer can.
TRUMAN
(deadpan)
Beer drinkers, by the look of it.



 



COOPER
(fascinated by every detail)
Where is the symbol?
This way.

HAWK

Hawk swings his flashlight beam across the cave, illuminates the far wall. And a ROCKY
SHAPE upon it. Cooper and Truman aim their beams as well, step closer.
Yes ...

COOPER

The rocky symbol is a rough-hewn rendering of Cooper's drawing. An easily discernable shape
extruding from the cave wall. It does not appear to be man-made.
COOPER
(to self)
Two symbols combined into a larger whole. But for
what purpose?
TRUMAN
(the skeptic)
I don't know, Coop. It's similar, there's no denying that.
COOPER
It's more than similar, Harry. The tattoos are a
question. And this, somehow, is the answer.
Andy listens gravely, pick-axe over his shoulder, afraid. He flashes his light upon the symbol,
forces himself a little closer. As if determined to contribute despite his fears.
COOPER
Why do they call it Owl Cave?
SUDDENLY: an owl's SHRIEK to wake the dead, the FLAPPING of enormous wings,
something passes through the shadows overhead. Several things happen simultaneously:
Cooper, Hawk, and Truman whip their flashlights toward the passing sounds, but find nothing.
Andy yips, panics, and whirls about. His pick-axe STRIKING the cave symbol with a
mighty blow. Rocks chip and tumble, a sort of whooshing rumble is heard ... and a small
LANDSLIDE tumbles down upon his head.
Andy!

TRUMAN

All rush to his side, claw through the rocks and detritus. Andy lays beneath, bruised, stunned,
but essentially unharmed.





33-

 (2)
ANDY
What was that?
COOPER
(he stands, preoccupied)
An owl.
ANDY
I'm sorry. I destroyed a national monument.
TRUMAN
Forget it, Andy. It's just a rock. The important thing (notices Cooper's expression)
Coop?

Cooper isn't listening. He's shining his light on the cave wall, the section revealed by the slide.
His eyes are filled with wonder.
What is it?
I'm not sure.

TRUMAN
COOPER

Cooper steps forward, their beams join his to illuminate the wall. And there, partially
obscured by the rock that remains, is a CAVE PAINTING of startling color and design.
TRUMAN
Good God.
(reaching out to touch it)
It appears to be a hieroglyph. We'll need the proper
tools to excavate. Harry, I have no idea where this will
lead us. But I have a feeling, a definite feeling, it will
be a place both wonderful and strange.
Cooper reaches out to touch the mysterious design. HOLD ON the cave painting for a beat.
The rocky formation that once hid it from view.
CUT TO:

 EXT. THE GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT
Establish. Piano music is heard.
CUT TO:
28A. INT. CORRIDOR NEAR DINING ROOM
Cooper returns, speaking into his recorder.
COOPER
Diane. Wednesday night, late. Have just returned from from
a place called Owl Cave. How I got there is a long and
complicated story, but I will try to recount it
accurately. It all began with a pair of matching
tattoos...
Cooper stops, looks off. He sees someone familiar in the dining room/bar.
CUT TO:
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT
Annie Blackburne enters and sits alone at the bar, curious, uncertain. Will she ever be a part of
this world? Annie raises an arm, tentative, to flag the bartender. Her actions are not those of
someone timid or shy. But rather the first halting steps of a stranger new to a strange land.







 
ANNIE
Excuse me?
(off his look)
I'd like something to drink. I'm not exactly sure what.
BARTENDER
Ladies seem to like rum.
ANNIE
Rum. I'll have one, please. With...?
Tonic.

BARTENDER

The bartender steps off to fetch and pour. Annie turns her eyes back to the smokey room:
couples seated at tables, talking, intimate and close. Annie watches with fascination and
regret. A familiar VOICE penetrates her reverie. Agent Cooper.
Hello, Annie.
Hi.

COOPER
ANNIE

COOPER
Could I get you...
Annie notices the bartender has left her a cocktail.
ANNIE
No, thank you. I have rum and tonic.
I see.

COOPER

ANNIE
One of the Sister's put rum in her tea. I've never tasted it
before, but it sounds exotic. so I ...
(off his look)
I lived in a convent for five years. I might as well be
from Mars.
COOPER
You're doing fine. You're here, on your own. And you
have rum and tonic.
Cooper speaks with quiet humor and affection. Just the support Annie needs. She smiles
appreciatively, lifts the glass to her lips, takes a drink. Reacts curiously. Not unpleasant.






 (2)
Cooper watches her gazing at the room, the wonder and doubt in her eyes. Annie senses him
watching her, Cooper wonders:
COOPER
It's all new to you. Everything.
ANNIE
I feel constantly amazed ... stunned. Music, people.
The way they laugh and talk. Some of them so clearly
in love. It's like a foreign language to me. I know just
enough of the words to realize how little I understand.
COOPER
I'd like to see the world through your eyes.
Why?

ANNIE

COOPER
There are things I would do differently if I had the
chance to start over again.
Me too.

ANNIE

Annie pauses, as if to consider a painful memory. She reaches for her glass of water, her sleeve
slips up, reveals scars on her wrist. Cooper sees it, says nothing. But Annie knows he saw them.
ANNIE
The thing is, I've failed before. I'm afraid I might fail
again.
COOPER
Do you want to talk about it?
ANNIE
(simply, without rancor)
Not yet.
A beat. Cooper peers at Annie, feels something turn inside his heart. He falls in love.
COOPER
Can I help you, Annie?
Can you?

ANNIE

COOPER
Show you the world. Will you let me?








 (3)
ANNIE
(after a beat)
I'm stubborn. Extremely willful.
COOPER
I can handle that.
ANNIE
Some people think I'm weird.
COOPER
I know the feeling.
ANNIE
I can't promise you I'd always make sense, or do the
things you expect me to.
COOPER
I don't expect anything.
ANNIE
(beat, then a big smile)
Then I accept your kind and generous offer.
Cooper smiles in kind, reaches out to touch Annie's hand and hold it, just below the scars. He's
wanted to touch her from the first moment they met.
CUT TO:
 INT. OWL CAVE - NIGHT
SUDDENLY - CAMERA follows a flashlight beam as it pierces the darkness inside Owl
Cave. The beam splashes light upon the cave's rocky walls, then, finally, holds on the landslide
aftermath, the symbol's fragment, the cave painting revealed beneath.
A beat. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals the man holding onto the flashlight, now staring
intently at the cave painting. It is Windom Earle.
EARLE

My, my, my. What have we here?

FADE IN:


INT. OWL CAVE - DAY
OPEN ON the interior of Owl Cave, dark and silent. Suddenly: VOICES coming closer.
COOPER, TRUMAN, etc.
This way... careful Andy...
Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. AGENT COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN,
DEPUTY HAWK and DEPUTY ANDY enter. Cooper and Truman carry flashlights,
backpacks filled with excavation equipment. Hawk holds a bright lantern. Andy is armed
with sketch pad, pencils. All pause, turn toward the cave symbol. Cooper reacts with a curse.
Dammit.

COOPER

The painting has been tampered with, ten dowels, with obscure symbols attached, now extend
from it, seemingly abstract, without obvious intent or meaning.
But who...?

TRUMAN

Hawk kneels at the base of the painting, casts lantern light upon the cave floor. He's examining
fresh tracks left in the dirt. Cooper steps toward him.
HAWK
I saw the same tracks outside the power station. Weight
shift to the left foot. A break in the heel.
COOPER
Windom Earle.
TRUMAN
What would Earle be doing here?
COOPER
That's a frightening question to contemplate.
(turns to face the others)
Andy. I need an accurate, large scale rendering of this
painting. Harry, we need to speak to Major Briggs
immediately.
TRUMAN
(mystified, but supportive)
Whatever you say, Coop. I'll call from the jeep.
Cooper nods assent. Truman exits. Hawk steps to Andy, casts additional light upon the
painting as the deputy draws and copies. Copper pivots, gazes at the mysterious image. As if
to wonder where it might lead him.
CUT TO:








INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
START CLOSE on WINDOM EARLE. Seated in an armchair, pipe in hand, avuncular in
aspect, he begins:
EARLE
Once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness
called the White Lodge. Fawns gamboled there amidst
happy laughing spirits. The sounds of innocence and
laughter filled the air. When it rained it rained sweet
nectar that paralyzed the heart with the desire to live
one's life in truth and beauty.
(beat)
Generally speaking, a ghastly place reeking of virtue's
sour smell, engorged with the whispered prayers of
kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools young
and old compelled to do good without reason. But, I
am pleased to note, our story does not end in this place
of saccharine excess.
As he speaks, CAMERA PANS from Earle, travels toward his unseen audience, revealing
LEO JOHNSON seated cross-legged on the floor, as if listening to a bedtime story.
EARLE
For there is another place, its opposite, of almost
unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and
vicious secrets. No prayers dare penetrate this frightful
maw. Spirits there care not for good deeds and priestly
invocations. They are as like to rip the muscle from
our bones as greet you with a happy g'day. And, if
harnessed, these spirits, this hidden land of unmuffled
screams and broken hearts, will offer up a power so vast
that its bearer might reorder the earth itself to his liking.
(beat)
This place I speak of, is known as the Black Lodge. And
I intend to find it.
CAMERA CONTINUES to PAN, reveals a dull-witted YOUTH seated at Leo's school
desk. Long stringy hair, head band, a vacant stare. Some sullen refugee from a speed metal
talent show.
YOUTH
Listen, man. The story's cool. But you promised me
beer. Besides, you told me there was gonna be a party up
here. Black Lodge, White Lodge, like what's the big
deal?
CAMERA CONCLUDES its move, HOLDS ON Earle's computer screen, where we see a
computer rendering of the hieroglyph from Owl Cave.











EARLE
In time, young man. Everything in time.

CUT TO:

PETE MARTELL sits at his chess board, peering silently at the pieces, morose, mournful.
PETE
(nearly whispered)
I think I shall never see, a girl as lovely as Josie...
(pauses, starts again; he's composing a poem)
When she walked into the flowers stood up
and...
(seeking rhyme)
Room... doom... fume... gloom...
(beat)
I think I shall never see, a girl as lovely as Josie, when she
walked into the room, the flowers were all abloom...
(tearing up)
Oh Josie...
Pete's poetic reverie is interrupted when CATHERINE MARTELL storms into the room.
She's carrying the mysterious black box Eckhardt gave her.
CATHERINE
Pete! Stop your incessant moping and give me a hand
with this damn box.
PETE
What exactly do you want me to do?
CATHERINE
Open it. I've been trying all morning. Thomas
Eckhardt left this box to me when he died. I want it
opened and I want it opened now.
PETE
(taking box into his hands)
Well ... let's take a look-see... do you have a key?
CATHERINE
If I had a key, it would be be open already, don't you
think?









PETE
'Course there's no key hole...
(he plays with the sides and edges of the box,
pieces that interact as if part of a larger puzzle)
It's a puzzle box. Saw one of these at a crafts emporium
in Guam. I was taking a little R and R with the
Doolittle twins, there was this monkey show that you
wouldn't believe, and Dale Doolittle, he was the larger
of the two, come to think of it, for twins they didn't
look at all alike...
PETE!!!

CATHERINE

PETE
Sorry, Poodle.
(returns to the box, the slats and sections)
The trick is to fit the pieces together just so...
CATHERINE
(with renewed hope)
Yes. And how long is that going to take?
Pete concentrates on the puzzle box, brow furrowed, lips pursed. A long beat.
PETE
This could take years.

CUT TO:

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

BOBBY BRIGGS and SHELLY JOHNSON sit in a booth. Shelly is in uniform, she's got
tables to attend to - but Bobby insists:
BOBBY
Shel, I've been thinking about the future, about what it
takes to get ahead in this world. I'm reading up,
watching TV: suddenly it comes to me. Boom. The
secret to success.
(leaning closer, dead serious)
Beautiful people get everything they want.
Oh, Bobby...

SHELLY









BOBBY
Think about it. When's the last time a pretty blonde
went to the electric chair? You arc very beautiful, Shelly,
and I think it's time we took advantage of the Beautiful
People's Conspiracy.
SHELLY
(sardonic)
Know any senators I can marry?
BOBBY
(pulling pamphlet from his jacket)
Check it out. Miss Twin Peaks. Once we get that crown
on your head, the sky's the limit.
SHELLY
(a little weary of pipedreams)
Dream on, Bobby. I got tables to wait on...
BOBBY
(curt)
Don't argue. Bobby's in charge, understand? You gotta
enlist by this afternoon.
It's an order, not a request. Bobby holds out the brochure. Shelly pauses, wounded by his
attitude. He doesn't care what she thinks. But Shelly takes the brochure nonetheless.



ANOTHER BOOTH
MAYOR MILFORD and LANA BUDDING-MILFORD share a booth nearby.
LANA
There's something I want you to do for me. Darling.











MILFORD
I'll do anything mind and body can stand. Surely the
last few days have been proof of that. You just name it.
LANA
(carefully considered)
I want to win the Miss Twin Peaks contest.
MILFORD
You just name it.
LANA
I want to win the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

MILFORD
Of course. I've given a speech or two in my time. I'll.
coach you day and night.
Dear, that's not what I'm thinking about. You're one of
the judges.
(to the point one more time)
You can guarantee it.
MILFORD
(after a long beat)
But... but... but... but... it would be wrong.
LANA
(reaching out to caress)
Oh, darling. It would be love. That's all.
Mayor Milford grumbles, looks about, then back into the eyes of the woman he loves.

MILFORD
I'll do anything for you, Lana. You know that.
LANA
Yes, lover. I do.



CUT TO:

AT THE COUNTER

ANNIE BLACKBURNE carries a pot of coffee, offers a refill or two. She reaches the cash
register ... and finds Cooper waiting for her. Annie brightens like the sun.
Hi.

ANNIE

COOPER
Morning, Annie.
Breakfast?

ANNIE

COOPER
Sorry. I've got a police cruiser full of hungry lawmen
waiting in the parking lot. A box of donuts, to go. And
a cup of hot coffee for the road.
ANNIE
Coming right up.
Annie turns to retrieve, a little disappointed. Cooper watches her calls out.
COOPER
And Annie...?
(off her look, unusually awkward)
I was wondering if you were available later for a little
nature study. Together.
ANNIE
Nature study? Sure.
COOPER
(realizing)
How strange.
What?

ANNIE

COOPER
When I speak to you I get am odd tingling sensation in
my stomach and toes.









ANNIE
Interesting. I'll get those donuts.
Annie steps away. Shelly rings up a sale on the cash register, frowns as Bobby steps to the door
without a goodbye. Then, at last, he turns to face her.
BOBBY
You're beautiful, Shelly. Got it? So take advantage.
Bobby makes her feel like it's a curse. Bobby exits. Shelly sighs, quotes:
SHELLY
What is all this sweet work worth, if thou kiss not me?

Shelly turns to see Cooper staring at her. He looks as though he's seen a ghost.
COOPER
What did you say?

SHELLY
Someone sent me a poem. It was anonymous.
COOPER
I need to see that poem immediatley, Shelly. Please.
Sure.

SHELLY

Shelly reaches under the counter, retrieves her purse. She hands her third of the poem to
Cooper. He inspects it.
SHELLY
We each got a piece. Donna, Audrey, and me.
COOPER
I'll have to take this with me.
Shelly nods assent. Annie returns bearing donuts and coffee.
ANNIE
One dozen to go. Cup of coffee.







(2)
COOPER
Thank you very much.
Cooper pays in a hurry, turns for the door without another word.
ANNIE
Agent Cooper...?
(off his look)
This afternoon...?
COOPER
I'll meet you here. Four o'clock sharp.
With that, he vanishes, clutching Shelly's poem along with the donuts and joe. HOLD ON
Shelly and Annie. They exchange a look, wonder what's on his mind.
FADE TO BLACK.

ACT TWO
FADE IN:


INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
OPEN ON Deputy Andy in the station conference room. He stands at the blackboard,
painstakingly reproduces the cave painting upon it. Andy erases, alters, draws primitive lines
on the slate.

 SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE

CUT TO:

Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman confer in the latter's office. Truman examines the poem
fragment Shelly gave to Cooper.
TRUMAN
Mountains kiss... waves clasp... what's this all about,
Coop?
COOPER
It's part of a poem, torn into thirds. Sent to Shelly
Johnson, Audrey Horne, and Donna Hayward... by
Windom Earle.
TRUMAN
Earle's contacted all three? Are you sure?
COOPER
(quoting the poem from memory)
See the mountains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother...
(beat)
I sent this same poem to Caroline once.
TRUMAN
I don't like the sound of this.
COOPER
It may be nothing more than a taunt. Earle takes a sick
pride in his ability to insinuate himself into innocent lives.
TRUMAN
And if it's not?
COOPER
Let's talk to the girls as soon as possible. See what they
recall.
Deputy Hawk enters.




 



HAWK
Major Briggs is here. Conference room.
(offering manila envelope)
Donna Hayward's poem. Audrey Horne is in Seattle
until tomorrow.

Cooper opens the envelope, removes another fragment, aligns it with the first on Truman's
desk. He peers at the poem for a beat, preoccupied, an idea forming. Hawk turns to exit.
COOPER
Hawk?
(off his look)
Bring me Leo Johnson's arrest report. Anything that
might have his handwriting on it.
Hawk, nods, exits. Truman wonders:
TRUMAN
What's the connection?
COOPER
(staring at poem fragments)
There isn't one. Yet.
 CONFERENCE ROOM

CUT TO:

Major Briggs watches Deputy Andy transcribe the cave painting with fascination. As Andy
connects two figures, the Major suddenly interrupts:
BRIGGS
Deputy Brennan? As I remember, the line you are
drawing should proceed downward, not across.
Andy checks the original rendering on his sketch pad. Andy erases, redraws. Then it hits him.
He turns to Major Briggs, mystified.
ANDY
How did you know that?
Cooper and Truman enter.
COOPER
Major Briggs. We need your help. Yet I find it
difficult to accurately describe why or how.
BRIGGS
(on the same wave length)
Go on.



 



COOPER
The Twin Peaks Sheriffs department is currently
involved in several disparate investigations. The
disappearance of a known felon, Leo Johnson. The
appearance of my former partner, a murderer, Windom
Earle. And the discovery of an ancient hieroglyph in a
place called Owl Cave.
(beat)
Logic demands that these investigations remain separate
entities. But recent developments suggest otherwise. I
believe that these mysteries are not separate entities, but
are in fact complimentary verses of the same song. I
cannot hear the song yet, Major Briggs. But I can feel it.
And that is enough for me to proceed.
BRIGGS
As a military man, I am familiar with damage done by
blind adherence to logic. How exactly may I help you?
COOPER
I need to know everything there is to know about
Windom Earle's work with Project Blue Book.
BRIGGS
That would involve accessing classified Air Force
computer files.
COOPER
Yes, it would.
BRIGGS
My security clearance was revoked shortly after my
disappearance.
COOPER
And your ability to access the Blue Book files?
BRIGGS
The issue is not one of access. There are, however,
certain moral judgements I must consider.
Of course.

COOPER

BRIGGS
Will this information help you to prevent future loss of
life?
Yes.

COOPER



 (2)



BRIGGS
Can you gain this intelligence without my intervention?
No.

COOPER

Pause. Briggs rises, steps to the blackboard. Andy's rendering of the cave painting upon it.
BRIGGS
Is this a copy of the hieroglyph you found in Owl Cave?
COOPER
(joining Briggs)
Yes. Do you know it?
BRIGGS
I have dreamed it. Or seen it. Somewhere. Somehow.
Briggs stares at the hieroglyph for a long beat. Then turns to face Cooper and the rest.
BRIGGS
I will do what you ask.
Deputy Hawk enters with a file, hands it to Cooper.
HAWK
Leo Johnson's arrest report.
Cooper takes the file, opens it. He finds examples of Johnson's handwriting. As the others
look on, Cooper arrays the sample next to the poem fragments. As he works:
COOPER
The damage Leo suffered would no doubt alter certain
handwriting characteristics. But his basic style remains
the same...
(putting the pieces together, turning to the others)
This poem, sent by Windom Earle, was transcribed by
Leo Johnson.
TRUMAN
Leo's working for Earle?
COOPER
(looking back at poem)
Yes. Or is his captive.
HOLD ON this tableau for a beat. Cooper, Truman, Hawk, Andy, and Major Briggs. The
evidence before them. Verses to the same song.

 INT. THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
START CLOSE on DICK TREMAYNE carefully adjusting an unwieldy nose bandage.
Tremayne frowns, sniffs. Then spots someone OFF-SCREEN.
TREMAYNE
(a rather nasal quality)
Mr. Horne!!
Tremayne hurries to intercept BEN HORNE as he passes through the dining room.
Yes?

BEN

TREMAYNE
Mr. Horne as you are no doubt aware there are but scant
hours until our wine tasting benefit begins and I cannot
find your daughter anywhere.
BEN
Audrey is spending the day in Seattle. However, I'm
sure our concierge will be happy to assist.
TREMAYNE
The concierge. Yes, capital. Thank you Mr. Horne.
Tremayne rushes on. But Horne calls after.
BEN
(doesn't know his name)
Excuse me. You there.
TREMAYNE
(turning to face him)
Richard Tremayne, sir. Men's fashions.
BEN
Of course. Tell me, how is your nose?
TREMAYNE
Oh, Mr. Horne. Think nothing of it. A nose is a small
price to pay in the service of a greater good.
BEN
We'll of course take care of your medical expenses.
TREMAYNE
(sycophant and conniver both)
How kind. One might also think worker's compensation
of some variety will be involved...







 
Easily done.

BEN

TREMAYNE
Capital, Mr. Horne. I'll alert my attorney.
Tremayne scurries off. Horne frowns, sighs.
BEN
(to self)
Sometimes the urge to do bad is nearly overpowering.
(mimicking nasal Trumayne)
I'll alert my attorney.
Ben sighs, extracts a carrot from his pocket. Stalks away.

 INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
CUT TO:
Windom Earle opens a beer, hands it to Leo, speaks to the heavy metal youth, OFF-SCREEN.
EARLE
Drink up, friend. We celebrate.
Leo carries the beer to the youth, now revealed INSIDE a huge papier mache CHESS PIECE.
YOUTH
Celebrate? I can barely move my arms.
Leo carefully puts the can to the youth's lips, offers a hearty swallow. Earle places the last few
pieces upon the wire frame, effectively encasing the heavy metal youth inside.
EARLE
You have lived your short life in odium and obscurity.
But now, at the end, you will step upon the larger stage.
I must confess, I envy you. Your journey begins at a point
beyond imagining. Who knows where you might travel






 
from there?



EARLE 

YOUTH
I'm pumped. Is this for the Lilac Parade or what?
EARLE
Not a parade, my friend. Not exactly.
YOUTH
Well I'm real cool about helpin' out and everything. But
how do I get out of this thing?
EARLE
(simply)
You don't.
Earle reaches into a chest, produces a wooden bow. He turns to Leo, orders.
EARLE
Leo. Fetch me an arrow.
Leo pauses - he's been feeding beer to the youth all along - turns to regard him.
YOUTH
Arrow. Whoa, man. I do not appreciate practical jokes.
EARLE
Leo. The arrow.
Leo sets the can of beer upon a table, faces Earle. And does not move. He manages:
N.... no.

LEO

Earle doesn't hesitate. He grabs the shock collar remote, presses the appropriate button. Leo
shivers and falls, struck down by its power.
YOUTH
Jeez, don't zap the geek. How'm I supposed to get my
beer without...
Earle zaps Leo a second time, lifting him clear of the floor. Leo moans, crawls to his knees.
YOUTH
Oh, dude ... that's gotta hurt...
EARLE
Fetch me... an arrow.









 (2)
Leo staggers, stands. And walks to a basket near his makeshift bed. He retrieves an arrow whittled to perfection, armed with a wicked steel point - and brings it back to Earle.
LEO
(wounded and fearful)
Arrow...
EARLE
Thank you, Leo.
Earle turns back to the papier mache chess piece, the youth trapped inside.
YOUTH
What's with the arrow, man... what are you doing?! This
isn't funny, man. This is not funny.
EARLE
Please. Be still.
YOUTH
What the hell are you doing...?!?
EARLE
(loading arrow as the youth continues to plead)
Think of all the hapless sinners, wondering where their
soul's destination lies? Think of the prayers and the
doubt, the gut-sucking fear that visits late at night. And
for what? To gain the answer to a simple question.
Where will my spirit wake? What life am I given after
my life? This grave question has plagued man's sorry
conscience for eons. And you, lucky boy, have the
answer... now.
Earle UNLEASHES the arrow, it tears through the air, pierces the heart of the papier mache
chess piece... and the heart of the heavy metal youth inside.
ANGLE ON CHESS PIECE
The arrow buried up to the hilt. A small trickle of blood seeping from the hole it makes.
ANGLE ON LEO
Watching the later with undisguised shock and horror. Wakened from one nightmare to
another.
FADE TO BLACK.

 INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
A rectangular table on stage at the roadhouse. MAYOR MILFORD, DOC HAYWARD,
PETE MARTELL sit facing BEN HORNE. Doc gavels the small committee to order.
DOC
The "Miss Twin Peaks Judging and Rules" committee is
hereby in session.
MILFORD
This is going to be a very exciting year. A very exciting
year. A very exciting year.
DOC
Thank you, Dwayne. First order of business; Ben Horne
has asked to address the committee as a Friend of the
Committee.
MILFORD
I don't have any objection to that.
PETE
Address away, Ben.
BEN
Thank you. And Dwayne, may I congratulate you on
your recent engagement.
MILFORD
Think you very much.
BEN
She's a lovely girl and I wish you much happiness.
MILFORD
Thank you very much.
BEN
Gentlemen. My purpose is simple. The age of the
ogling, swimsuited jiggle festivals of the past is dead.
Miss Twin Peaks, I believe rightly, is now a celebration
of the totality of a woman's qualities. Beauty has taken
on a broader definition that includes mind, values, ideas
and for taking that step, gentlemen, I applaud you.
MILFORD
What's he selling? What are you selling?



 



BEN
Let me get night to the point. The centerpiece of your
voting procedure is the Contestants Address to the
Town. Miss Twin Peaks is an event in search of a theme.
What I propose is simple: the to pic of this year's
speeches should be; How to Save Our Forests.
(pause, for effect)
It's now, it's relevant, it's global, it's, to put it plainly,
gentlemen ... us.

Pause. The committe members look at each other.
PETE
'Course your opposition to the Ghostwood development
plans wouldn't have anything to do with this.
BEN
Pete, I have to say I resent your implication. The
environmental issues here clearly dwarf any parochial
business concern that I or you or anyone else might be
pursuing.
DOC
We'll take it under advisement.
MILFORD
We'll take it under advisement.
BEN
The best I could hope for. Thank you, gentlemen, for
your time.
Ben rises and briskly exits.
PETE
Thinks he can pull a fast one.
MILFORD
The idea has merit. The idea has merit.
DOC
I'm in favor of it, myself
MILFORD
As am I. Good topic. Lively material.
PETE
Okay, okay. Let's start processing the candidates, I
gotta get back to the chess board.

BOBBY

Hey, Chief.
BEN
Bobby. Wine tasting party, eight o'clock.
BOBBY
With bells on.
Donna watches Ben carefully. Ben nods to her, exits. Pete announces to the waiting group.
PETE
Would the first candidate please approach the
committe.
MILFORD
(cutting through the red tape)
Lana? Come on up honey.
Lana sashays up to the stage, sits in font of the committee.
I smell a fix.

BOBBY

SHELLY
I don't know if I can do this, Bobby. I've never given a

Gardner's class in fourth grade and I passed out right in
front of the whole room.
BOBBY
You'll be great, doll. I'm gonna be your speechwriter.
DONNA
It's not as hard as you think, Shelly.
SHELLY
I could sure use that scholarship money.
MIKE NELSON and NADINE enter. Nadine moves to Donna.
NADINE
Donna, are you entering too?



 



DONNA
Uh, yeah. You too, huh?
NADINE
Wouldn't miss it for the world. Isn't it exciting?
Uh, yeah.

DONNA

Bobby gestures to Mike, takes him aside.
BOBBY
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.
MIKE
(trying to affect nonchalance)
Hey, long time no see.
BOBBY
I'd ask where you been keeping yourself but I think I
know ...
(a look at Nadine)
This is very scary, Mike.
MIKE
It's not what you think.
BOBBY
It's not what I think? What do you think I think?
MIKE
You think I'm going out with an older woman.
BOBBY
I think I don't know where you got this sudden interest
in the life of fossils.
MIKE
(a knowing smile)
Yeah, I know. It's not what you think.
BOBBY
Mike. Big favor. Clear this up for me.
MIKE
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
BOBBY
I will strive to be understanding.

MIKE

Do you have any idea what a combination of sexual
maturity and superhuman strength can result in?

Bobby looks at him, a glimmer of comprehension forming. Mike whispers something more
elaboarte and descriptive in his ear.

Harry Truman sits with Catherine.
TRUMAN
(sincerely)
If there's anything you can tell me about her at all.
Anything to help me understand.
For instance.

CATHERINE

TRUMAN
What did she want? Why did she do the things she did?
CATHERINE
I'm asking myself a lot of the same questions.
TRUMAN
I want to know. I want to believe she wasn't all bad.
There was something good there. Decent.
CATHERINE
(pasue, honestly)
I think early in her life she must have learned the lesson
that she could survive by being what other people wanted




 




CATHERINE 
to see. Showing them that. It was probably something
she had no choice about. And I think that eventually
became the largest truth in her life. In time even she no
longer knew who she truly was. She, I don't know quite
how to say this ... she lost her ... center. What was left of
her private self she may never have shown anyone.
TRUMAN
So the lies, all the stories ...
CATHERINE
Who knows? They may not have seemed untrue to her.
What she needed to believe was always shifting to suit
the moment. A ball of knots. Knotted, tangled string.
In spite of everything she tried to do to me and my
family I find it's curiously hard to hate her for it.
TRUMAN
(almost privately)
... she was so beautiful.

Catherine looks at him.
CATHERINE
Maybe there's some clue we can both benefit from.
What's that?

TRUMAN

Catherine removes the box from her desk.
CATHERINE
Thomas Eckhardt left this for me when he died. It
occured to me it might have something to do with her.
TRUMAN
What's inside?
CATHERINE
I don't know. I haven't been able to open it.
Let me see.

TRUMAN

Truman takes the box. Runs his hands over the intricate filligree work.
TRUMAN 
There's no handle or lid.

Sound of a door opening. Pete enters, under a head of enthusiastic steam.
PETE
Wowee Bob, we got some beauties in the contest this
year, hello, Harry, seems like every gal in town's lining
up to take a shot at the - say, any luck with this thing?
Pete takes the box from Harry.
CATHERINE
(with a sigh)
Not yet.
Pete drops the box on the floor.
PETE
(kneeling to retrieve it)
Whoops.
CATHERINE
Butterfingers...
Pete's not listening. He's staring at the mysterious box. A seamless top lid is slowly,
automatically sliding open.
PETE
Holy moley ...
What is it?

CATHERINE

Pete looks inside, pulls out a small version of the larger box. This one has a finely filigreed
lid, the twelve signs of the zodiac inscribed on its surface.
CATHERINE
Give it to me.
PETE
(an idea forms)
Just a sec, Poodle...
Pete carefully drops the second box, as if certain it will open if dropped like the first. No
such luck. Undaunted, Pete retrieves it, means to drop the box again.
Pete...

The small rowboat. Cooper pulls in the oars, they'll drift together.
ANNIE
I used to swim out here when I was a kid. Every
summer. Two, three times a week.
COOPER
I can understand why. It's beautiful.
ANNIE
I guess even then I felt a closer connection nature than
I did to people. I was kind of a weird kid.







 
COOPER
Really? How?
ANNIE
That's what people used to say. Never had many
friends. Norma was Miss Popularity. Seemed like she
was always moving towards the world. I was always
moving away from it. I lived in my head, mostly.
COOPER
Not a bad neighborhood.
ANNIE
(quietly self-deprecating)
Well there were some pretty strange neighbors.
COOPER
(another topic)
Boyfriends?
ANNIE
No. No. I ... well, I had one.
High school?
Senior year.

COOPER
ANNIE

COOPER
Anything to do with your going into the convent?
ANNIE
I'm sorry, do you mind if we don't talk about it?
COOPER
We can talk about whatever you like.
ANNIE
(slowly, trying to be resolute)
I want to come back to the world. I was so frightened
for so long. Of everything. Of life. I thought I'd be
safe there. Everybody here thought I was nuts. And when
I think about it, it was such a weird nineteenth century
thing to do. To think I could remove myself, as if that
could stop the noise in my head, when the problem
was me, it was always in ... me ...



 (2)



COOPER
(softly, looking at her)
I understand.
ANNIE
Silence. Prayer. It wasn't the religion. It could have
been a Buddhist retreat. Walden Pond. A quiet room.
(she turns to him)
But you sit in a room like that long enough and you
realize, I realized that I was just hiding and that running
away from my fear didn't make the fear go away ...
COOPER
It made it stronger.
ANNIE
(a tear in her eye)
Yes. So I had to face it. I had to face myself. And I
have to do it here. Where everything went so wrong.

Cooper takes her hand. She lets him hold it. He touches the scars on her wrists. She doesn't
withdraw the hand. Looks at him.
COOPER
(his way of asking why)
I know how hopeless things can seem. I know the kind of
dark tunnel you can fall into.
ANNIE
(decides to tell him this much)
It happened before I went away. It happened because of
that boy. I went away because of it. That's all you need
to know.
COOPER
(nods, pauses)
Annie, I ... I had a similar experience. Not the same.
Similar. I'd like to ... help you ... in any way I can ...
She kisses him. They speak very quietly.
ANNIE
I don't know you very well.
No.

DALE! GLAD I CAUGHT UP WITH YOU. THE
RENTAL'S FIRED UP AND I'M ABOUT TO HIT
THE ROAD.
COOPER
We'll miss you, Gordon. Hurry back You remember
Annie?
COLE
OF COURSE I DO. THE WORLD IS FULL OF
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
(aside, to Shelly)
Though only one I can hear.
(to Cooper)
JOIN US FOR PIE.
Cooper and Annie sit down opposite. A WAITRESS delivers two slices of cherry pie.
COLE
(distributing silverware, plates)
THANK YOU.
(to Shelly)
All right if we share?



23B. 
Sure.


28B.

SHELLY
(enjoying his attentions)

COLE
(as they eat pie)
COOP, I'M TOLD LOVE MAKES THE WORLD
GO ROUND. DRIVES A MAN INSANE. AND
MAKES PEOPLE WHO NEED PEOPLE THE
LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. BUT NO
ONE EVER MENTIONED A THING ABOUT A
CURE FOR HEARING LOSS.
(to Shelly)
You're a miracle worker. A goddess sent from heaven.
SHELLY
I'm a waitress in a diner that no one ever compared to a
goddess before.
COLE
Some people just don't know their own value.
(to Cooper)
SHE'S A RARE AND PRECIOUS INDIVIDUAL
DON'T YOU THINK?
COOPER
Yes, Gordon. She is.
COLE
Shelly, turn and face me before I lose my nerve.
Shelly looks up from her pie, faces him.
COLE
I'm about to leave Twin Peaks. I don't know when I'll
return. But I want you to know that meeting you has been
more than a privilege. It has touched my heart and soul.
And I know that if I don't kiss you now I will regret it
the rest of my days.
There's something sweet and kind in this dizzy oration. When Gordon leans close to kiss her,
Shelly receives him without hesitation. Cooper looks on with a smile: The whole world is in
love. just then: Bobby Briggs enters, stops and stares.
BOBBY
What the hell is going on here...?
Cole breaks from the kiss, regards the angry youth, grins.





28C.

23B. (2)
COLE
TWO ADULTS ARE SHARING A TENDER
MOMENT, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
(to Shelly)
Poor kid acts like he never saw a kiss before.
(to Bobby)
WATCH CLOSELY, SON. IT GOES LIKE THIS.
COOPER
(trying to avoid scene)
Gordon...
Too late. Cole kisses Shelly again, with gusto. Bobby watches, open-mouthed, stunned
silent. Who is this guy?

Establish.
 INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Doc Hayward, Eileen, and Donna at dinner. The mood is quietly tense, nobody willing to say
what's on their mind. Food is passed, plates filled. But little is eaten.
EILEEN
Would you pass the peas, Donna?
DONNA
(while passing)
Mom, can I ask you a question?
Sure.

EILEEN

HAYWARD
(meaning to intercept)
Donna...
DONNA
How well do you know Ben Horne?
HAYWARD
(to the rescue)
Eileen, I told Donna about the Heal the Planet Benefit
you re working on.
EILEEN
(she's never heard of it)
Heal the Planet...?
HAYWARD
With Ben Horne.
DONNA
I was here when he came to the house. You went to see
him yesterday.
EILEEN
(groping in the dark)
Oh. Well, yes. Ben has offered some of his time.


 





HAYWARD
I know he favors several of the local charities.
DONNA
Maybe the charity sent Mom's roses.
HAYWARD
I put them by the bed.
EILEEN
Roses. That's nice.
(anything to stop this conversation)
Donna, would you pass the peas?
DONNA
I think roses are romantic, don't you?
HAYWARD
Donna, pass your mother the peas.
EILEEN
(receives the platter)
How's school?
DONNA
(a long beat, then grudgingly)
Just great. All the girls are real excited about Miss
Twin Peaks.
HAYWARD
It's a fine tradition. I've worked with the pageant for
years.
I entered.

DONNA

EILEEN
Really? But you never...
DONNA
Why not? I could use the scholarship money to study
overseas.
She means away from here. Eileen and Doc exchange a look. Donna simmers between.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR AREA - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Still wearing the cumbersome nose bandage, Dick Tremayne taps a wine glass with a knife,
calling the wine tasting party to order. A dozen or so people sit in the bar area, including Ben





 



Horne, Andy, Lucy, Lana Budding and a few of the models from the fashion show. Everyone
has two wine glasses in front of them and a spit bucket. On the table in front of Dick are a
number of wine bottles, covered in bags.
TREMAYNE
Good evening. Evening all. Welcome to our
oenophiliac soiree, another in a continuing series of
public events, sponsored by Horne Industries, to benefit
the Stop Ghostwood Development movement.
ANDY
(sotto)
Ono-what?
LUCY
(sotto)
Something to do with wine.
TREMAYNE
When my good friend, Ben Horne, asked me how would
I like to contribute to the Good Fight, I said to myself,
Dick, I said, you're a former sommelier why not try to
bring a little culture to the proceedings? I replied ... but
of course: a wine-tasting parry. Uplift the general level
of quality of life at the same time we're putting money
into the fight to save our trees. Voila!
(small, polite, smattering of applause)
I should of course mention that our wines this evening are
all courtesy of the Great Northern's wine cellar, thank
you, Ben, and now ... to the tasting! Lana, Lucy, if you'd
help me pour, please.
Lana and Lucy jump up to help him pour out the contents of the first tasting. Dick flirts rather
obviously with Lana, which Lucy can't fail to notice. She simmers as she pours.
TREMAYNE 
(as they pour)
Our first wines tonight are reds. There are some schools
of thought who of course say there are no other wines but
reds.
Andy raises his hand.
Yes, Andy.

TREMAYNE 

ANDY
(he's been studying)
There are also white wines and sparkling wines.






 (2)
TREMAYNE
(long-suffering)
Thank you, Andy.
(watching his charges; warmly)
Very good, Lana.
(not as warmly)
Don't pour quite so much, Lucy.
Another cold look from Lucy to Lana and Dick.
TREYMAYNE 
Now that we're all poured, let's first examine (to Andy, who's drinking)
Don't taste it, yet, Andy, for heaven's sake.
Andy has a mouthful of wine.
Spit it out.

TREMAYNE 

Andy spits into the bucket.
Sorry.

ANDY

TREMAYNE
That's all right. That's what we're here for: to learn.
Now, to the wine. First we must examine the nose of the
wine, to see what it can tell about its bouquet. And
we do that by ...
LANA
(the prize pupil)
By smelling.
TREMAYNE
Very good, Lana.
Another look from Lucy.
TREMAYNE 
Lift the glass thusly ...
(lifting it to his nose, now talking into the glass)
And while vigorously rolling the wine around in the
glass, we breathe deeply and fully.
Unbeknownst to him, the wine seeps into the gauze bandage on Tremayne's nose and a crimson
blotch starts to creep cellularly upwards.




 (3)




TREMAYNE 
That's good. Now, procedurally, we take our first
taste, a big, boisterous gulp and roll it energetically
around our entire palate, trying to involve those hard to
reach taste buds, tucked away in the back of our tongues.
Remembering not to swallow ...
The class takes a sip and rolls it around in their mouths.
TREYMAYNE 
Excellent. And now ... we ... spit.
As one, the group spits noisily into their buckets.
CUT TO:

 INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT

By the fireplace in the other room, Jack Wheeler enters and sits near a pensive Dale Cooper,
nursing a drink, staring into the fire. A beat. Wheeler emits a rueful sigh, thinking of Audrey.
A beat. Cooper allows a happy little whistle of satisfaction. He's thinking about Annie. A
beat. Wheeler sighs again. Cooper whistles. Both gradually aware of the other. Then, at last,
more to himself:
Love is hell.
Sorry?

WHEELER
COOPER

WHEELER
Love. It's hell.
COOPER
The Hindus say love is the ladder to heaven.
WHEELER
We're both right.
COOPER
"Proof of heaven, while we're living."
WHEELER
The Hindus have also been known to take a hike on hot
coals for recreational purposes.
COOPER
(a mild correction)
Self-discipline.




 



WHEELER
Self- discipline and love are a bad match.
COOPER
(agreeing; what he's facing)
Earthly love.
WHEELER
What other kind is there?
COOPER
When you're in it, none.
WHEELER
It hits you like an eighteen-wheeler. And there's no
relief.
COOPER
It makes you feel more alive.
WHEELER
And you feel more of everything. Pain included.
COOPER
Pain especially.
WHEELER
Can't think of anything but her.
No.

COOPER

WHEELER
She goes away, it's like a part of you's ripped out of its
socket.
COOPER
(a look at him)
Sounds like you've got a pretty serious case.
WHEELER
I am roped, tied and branded.
COOPER
She feel the same way?
WHEELER
(lifts his drink)
Here's hoping.




  (2)




Cooper lifts his drink in support.
WHEELER
How 'bout you? You on the critical list, too?
COOPER
(considers, then)
I feel like someone's taken a crowbar to my heart.
WHEELER
That's not bad.
COOPER
No. I think maybe it's been locked away long enough.
WHEELER
Then that's good.
COOPER
(lifts his drink)
Here's hoping.
WHEELER
Here's to you.
They drink. A beat. A VOICE interrupts:
VOICE
Mr. Wheeler, telegram for you, sir.
A BELLMAN holds out a telegram. Wheeler takes it, tips him. He opens the telegram. We
SEE it's from Brazil. Grim news.
WHEELER
Damn.
(to Bellman as he exits)
Bellman?
The Bellman stops, turns to regard him.
WHEELER
Tell the desk I'll be checking out. Thanks.
The Bellman exits. Wheeler collects his thoughts, rises.
WHEELER
(to Cooper, mind elsewhere)
Good night.





35A.

 
Cooper nods, watches as Wheeler steps away.
CUT TO:
 INT. BAR - NIGHT
The wine-tasting continues. Dick is hovering over Lana.
TREMAYNE
All right, class, what did that sip reveal to us? What
flavors are we enjoying?
LUCY
Tastes kind of woody.
TREMAYNE
No, not really. Anyone else? Lana?
Banana?

LANA

TREMAYNE
Yes, there is a hint of banana, that's the metachloric acid,
very good. What else?




 




LUCY
(under her breath)
Banana.
Chocolate.

ANDY

TREMAYNE
Correct, Andy, there is another acid, hydroxinine, which
is present in both flavors.
LUCY
Why don't we just skip the wine and have a banana split?
Registering, Lucy's mood, Dick pours more into Lana's glass, doting on her.
TREMAYNE
Let's have another sip, shall we, swallowing this time
and let's see what else we can discern.
LANA
Gosh, Dick, I never knew wine could have so many
different qualities.
TREMAYNE
Amazing, isn't it A really fine wine is like a
symphony. Strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion,
they're all present, playing in harmony.
Everyone sips. Dick turns to Lucy with a prefunctory tone.
TREMAYNE
And what reaction do you have Lucy?
She spits the wine out in his face.
LUCY
I'm pregnant. I'm not supposed to drink.
They look at each other.
CUT TO:
 OMIT



 EXT. GAZEBO - NIGHT




Police cars. Cops. Lights trained on the gazebo, where a large box sits in the center. Cooper
drives up, is greeted by Truman. They move towards the gazebo.
TRUMAN
We thought at first it might be a bomb. We don't
exactly have a bomb squad. It's weird.
COOPER
What did you do?
TRUMAN
Andy brought his metal detector. If it is a bomb it's
not metallic and there's no ticking sound, so...
(stopping Cooper)
Be careful, Coop, I think it is meant for you.
COOPER
I doubt it Harry. Windom is too precise. This will
have to do with some other itinerary on his peculiar
journey. When he tries to kill me it will be face to face
and far removed from chicanery or subtrafuge.
Cooper moves confidently up to the gazebo. Finds a small rope emerging from the top, with
a ring attached and a sign that reads, 'Pull Me."
COOPER
Let's see what he's up to.
He pull the ring. A moment later all four sides of the box begin to fall to the ground.
TRUMAN
(to the group)
Get back!
Cooper doesn't move as the box falls apart. Revealed inside is a large black, papier-mache
chess piece, a pawn. Sticking out of the top is the very dead head of Windom Earle's victim.
A sign on the pawn reads, "NEXT TIME. IT WILL BE SOMEONE YOU KNOW."
FADE TO
THE END



INT. DINER - DAY

Bobby and Shelly sit in a diner booth. Shelly holds a crumpled copy of her pageant speech.
SHELLY
(reading from speech)
"...and that's the only way we're ever going to save the
trees. It's time to stand up and kick some butt for our
environment. Before it's too late for all of us."
(gentle deadpan)
That's beautiful, baby. Letter perfect.
BOBBY
(the enthusiastic collaborater)
I'm not so sure about the "kicking butt" part. How 'bout
"Fight"?
(trying it out)
"It's time to stand up and fight for our environment?"
SHELLY
(quietly relieved, making correction)
Hundred per cent better.
BOBBY
(mind on something more important)
Shel ... I been thinkin'...
SHELLY
(putting pen and speech away)
I know, I know. The speech counts double everything else
in the contest BOBBY
I been thinking about us.
SHELLY
(looking up)
You were?
BOBBY
I know I haven't been paying the right kind of attention to
you lately. I got busy with Mr. Horne, I'm wearing suits,
okay? And suddenly I'm walkin' around like I'm more
important than everybody else.
SHELLY
You were pretty crummy. I was lonely, Bobby. I missed
all the things we used to do together.
BOBBY
When I saw you kissin' that guy, something snapped. It's











BOBBY 
like my brain rolled over. And I could see all the stuff
that's special to me. The stuff that matters.
(takes hold of her hand)
I love you, Shelly. I want to dedicate my time to that I
mean if that's okay with you.
A beat. Shelly smiles, leans closer.
SHELLY
What do you think?
She leans across the table to give him a long, passionate kiss. Finally:
BOBBY
(quietly)
Lucky, lucky me.
Suddenly: an OFF-SCREEN VOICE interrupts:
VOICE
Shelly! Phone. It's the Sheriffs office.
Shelly reacts, steps from the booth to answer.
CUT TO:







LUCY
What do you know about saving our planet?
ANDY
(after a beat)
I know it's in lots of trouble.
Lucy hands him a Miss Twin Peaks flyer.
LUCY
Andy, I'm taking fate into my own hands mostly
because the suspense is killing me. Tomorrow is D-Day.
"Dad Day." In twenty-four hours I will choose the father
of my child. Deputy Andrew Brennen. Or Clothing
Salesmen Richard Tremayne.
ANDY
(thrilled, frightened, confused)
What does that have to do with the Miss Twin Peaks
contest?
I-

LUCY

(remembering her baby)
We could use the money. We could also use a father.
(re flyer)
So I have to give a speech about saving our planet which
is a great concept but I have no idea how to go about
doing it. Yet.
ANDY
(looking up from flyer)
I do know that people have got to stop sinking their beer
cans in Pearl Lake when they're fishing.
LUCY
(grabbing pencil and paper)
Beer cans...
ANDY
And styrofoam never dies for as long as you live.
Lucy and Andy huddle together, consider man's fate.


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

The conference room transformed into a command center. The blinds are pulled, it's hard to









tell if it is day or night. At one end is the blackboard with a drawing of the cave painting. A
MOVE down the table reveals computers, more paraphanalia. Piles of charts, library books,
plus attempts to duplicate the dowels that shot out of the cave wall.
MAJOR BRIGGS, who looks like he's been up all night, guides Bookhouse Boy CAPPY
through a reference book while pointing at the drawing.
BRIGGS
See if any of these symbols have to do with harvest
schedules or ancient calendars. Look for any curious
nomenclature.
Got it, Chief.

CAPPY

Cappy gets to work. Cooper and Truman enter, exchange greetings.
COOPER
Garland, you're exhausted.
Briggs gestures toward a small box atop his desk filled with files, notebooks, a videotape.
BRIGGS
I spent the night obtaining and perusing the Project Blue
Book files regarding Windom Earle. I found it
impossible to sleep after.
COOPER
What did you learn?
BRIGGS
Windom Earle was the best and brightest among us. But
when our attention turned from outer space to the
wooded areas surrounding Twin Peaks, he became
destructively obsessive. Earle acted in an overzealous
and secretive manner. Possessive of his assignments.
And finally, violent. He was removed from the project.
Briggs reaches into the box, removes the video tape, inserts it into a VCR.
BRIGGS
I found this in the Project archives.
Briggs turns on recorder and monitor. A beat. GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE footage
appears on the screen. Slightly out of focus, as if gleaned from a surveillance camera.
WINDOM EARLE, younger, wearing a white lab coat, faces an unseen interrogater. He
speaks with quiet contempt:





(2)
EARLE ON SCREEN
(in mid-oration)
... these evil sorcerers, dugpas, they call them, cultivate
evil for the sake of evil and nothing else. They express
themselves in darkness for darkness, without leavening
motive. This ardent purity has allowed them to access a
secret place of great power, where the cultivation of evil
proceeds in exponential fashion. And with it, the
furtherance of evil's resulting power. These are not fairy
tales, or myths. This place of power is tangible, and as
such, can be found, entered, and perhaps, utilized in some
fashion. The dugpas have many names for it, but chief
among them is the Black Lodge.
(beat)
But you don't believe me, do you? You think I'm mad.
Overworked. Go away.
Earle turns from the unseen camera. The screen goes BLACK. Cooper presses rewind, means
to view the tape in its entirety. We SEE Earle's, in black and white, image in reverse. Cooper
speaks OVER, shares his thought as he forms them.
COOPER
When Windom Earle returned, I assumed he had come
for vengeance. For me. But I miscalculated. Windom
has insinuated himself into the lives of those I care for.
He has murdered innocents. He has engaged us in
subterfuge and red herring. But those acts were merely
camouflage. Windom Earle is after something else.
The Black Lodge.
(re Earle on monitor screen)
What I want to know is, what does that, the Black
Lodge, have to do...
(re the blackboard hieroglyph)
...with this?
TRUMAN
You think there's a connection?
COOPER
Windom does.
(beat)
Harry, let's divide up Earle's files, check them top to
bottom. Cappy, find out everything you can about the
evil sorcerers known as dugpas. Garland, maybe you
should get some sleep.
BRIGGS
I could use a good stretch. Perhaps a walk in the woods
to clear my head.










(3)
Fine. Harry?

COOPER

Cooper and Truman divide the files. CAMERA MOVES IN on a plant nearby. It's the
familiar bonsai ... and the electronic bug hidden within.


INT. EARLE'S CABIN

CUT TO:

WINDOM EARLE, earphone in place, listens and laughs. LEO JOHNSON stands next to
him.
EARLE
You know, Leo, the only thing Columbus discovered was
that he was lost. Cooper and the gang aren't even off the
snide, yet.
(studies the hieroglyph, in a sing song voice)
I know something they don't know.
(serious)
I know something Young Dale merely suspects.
MOVE BACK to see Earle has set up his own war room/command module. Bur Earle's work
seems more advanced and he has more equipment. The familiar chess board remains.
EARLE
Project Blue Book. Little men - pee wits loaded with
optimism. They were a deterrent so slight it was
practically encouragement.
Earle refers to his copy of the hieroglyph, means to transfer the image to his computer screen.
EARLE
Yet, I would like to ask Major Briggs a question or
three. Polish up that bald nub of his and see what shines.
Perhaps, Leo, we too should venture out for a good
stretch.
Earle brings the copy closer, compares it with his computer mockup. The chess board is in the
way. Earle sweeps it off the table. He is too absorbed in his work to notice Leo take the
CONTROL for the shock collar off the table and slide it into his pocket.


INT. HAYWARD HOUSE, ATTIC - DAY

CUT TO:

DONNA HAYWARD sits on the floor of the attic. Frustrated. She has been through a lot of
boxes, tins, and trunks and not found a thing. She pulls down another box and behind it spots a
SCRAPBOOK Across it's cover it reads, "The Palavan Club." As she pulls the scrapbook











down documents fall out of it. Picking them up she sees that they are BEARER BONDS for
HORNE INDUSTRIES. Mixed in with those is an envelope. Inside the envelope is a
BIRTH CERTIFICATE that reads:
DONNA
(reading)
"Female Child. Mother, Eileen Hayward. Daughter
Donna Marie."
The name of the father has been left blank. Donna opens the scrapbook. She pores through the
pictures coming upon a photograph of her parents at a costume party, dressed as hoboes. The
theme of the party is written on an arch in the picture. It says, "Better Days." Donna whips
through more of the pictures till she comes upon one that stops her. Eileen and Doc smile out
at her from some long ago party. In between them is a smiling Ben Horne, his arms about Doc
and Eileen.. Then there is a photo of Ben and Eileen together. Ben grinning at the camera.
Eileen grinning at Ben. Donna stares at the picture until she is startled by her Mother's voice
from below.
EILEEN'S VOICE
Donna? Donna where are you?
Donna scrambles to put the bonds and the birth certificate back into the scrapbook.
DONNA
What is it, Mom?
EILEEN'S VOICE
Deputy Hawk is on the phone.
DONNA
Be right there.
After one more look Donna hides the scrapbook.
CUT TO:
5A. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER stops at the desk. The clerk looks up from his work.
WHEELER

No sir.

CLERK

WHEELER

5A. 
No, sir.
You're sure?
Sorry, sir.

CLERK
WHEELER
CLERK

Nothing left to do. Wheeler sighs.
WHEELER
Would you send someone up for my bags.
CLERK
Perhaps you care to leave Ms. Horne a message.
Wheeler takes a pad from the clerk. Starts to write a note. Then crumples it up.
WHEELER
No. No. I'm afraid that isn't going to - Thanks.
Wheeler goes to the elevator.
CUT TO:






INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
Earle applies oil to his cross-bow, chatting with Leo, as is his custom, while he works.
EARLE
... you would have appreciated the dugpas, Leo. Ancient
sorcerers bent on evil. Rather like the Kali worshippers
of India. Another fine bunch of zanies, let me tell you.
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch ... those were the
good old days.
Earle looks up, sees Leo standing before the three playing card Queens attached to the bulletin
board. Audrey, Donna, and Shelly. Leo turns to Earle, disturbed, confused.
EARLE
Do my anecdotes bore you?
LEO
Sh...sh ... Shelly.
EARLE
Yes. Very good, Leo. You remember.
Sh ... Shelly.

LEO

EARLE
Tawdry little trollop. Just between you and me, old
boy, your wife has some fairly modern views on marital
fidelity. No matter, she is still fit for a Queen. Would
you mourn her passing, Leo? I doubt it.
Leo stares at the picture of Shelly, then back to Earle. Uncertain, confused. Earle clarifies:
EARLE
Her death, Leo. Shelly's imminent demise. It's really
very simple. Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks. Shelly
dies. Maybe you'd like to help.
Shelly. NO.

LEO

Leo understands. He means to save her. Leo reveals the shock collar control, waves it at Earle
is if the control, not the collar, delivered the painful shocks. Earle spies it, reacts with mock fear.
EARLE
My god, what do you have there, Leo?
(as Leo moves towards him)
No. Dear God, no.
(Leo waves the control at him)










EARLE 
I'm begging you, Leo. I prithee, no. Have mercy.
Leo points the control at Earle.
LEO
Love .... Shelly ....
Leo hits the control and shocks himself. He flips about, confused. Earle moves to Leo.
Confused and frightened, Leo continues to pump on the control and continues to shock himself.
Finally, Earle takes the control from his helpless hand.
EARLE
Poor, Leo. We are all love's fools, more or less.
Earle takes out a pair of shackles, attaches them to Leo's legs.
EARLE
But you will learn, as I have, the value of hate. It makes
for better company I assure you.

INT. DOUBLER DINER - DAY
ANNIE BLACKBURNE cleans the counter, crumples up one of the ubiquitous Miss Twin
Peaks flyers. She looks up to see Cooper.
COOPER

Can't hurt to give it a shot.
ANNIE
(with a smile)
Maybe next year.
COOPER
There's a whole new world out there, Annie. jump in.

"Hear the other side. See the other side."
ANNIE
(recognizing quote, pleased)
St. Augustine. Coffee?
You bet.

COOPER

Annie pours, takes a closer look. Faint doubt amidst his ardor.
ANNIE
Something's troubling you.

Yes.

COOPER
(surprised)

ANNIE
Do you want to talk about it?
COOPER
(after a beat)
I am involved in a complicated investigation that
requires my total attention. Yet I spend most of my
time thinking about you.
ANNIE
I know the feeling. I've been seeing your face in fried
eggs all morning.








COOPER
There are those who believe in a scientific basis for
attraction. It's chemical.
ANNIE
Is that what this is?
COOPER
I don't know. Is it possible to understand without
perspective?
ANNIE
I spent five years trying.
Faith.

COOPER

ANNIE
It's difficult for me. But I have faith in you. In us, as I
understand it.
COOPER
We are very much alike.
It helps.

ANNIE

COOPER
But we think too much.
ANNIE
(her turn to quote)
"What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed
to our method of questioning."
COOPER
(his turn to recognize)
Heisenberg.
They share a warm beat. Kindred spirits from another time and place. Annie deadpans:
ANNIE
Maybe we should go bowling.
No. Dancing.

COOPER

ANNIE
I don't know how.








(2)
I'll teach you.
When?
Tonight.

COOPER
ANNIE

Cooper takes her hand. They hesitate. Then, awkwardly, eagerly, they lean across the
countertop to kiss.


INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY

CUT TO:

Decorations for the Miss Twin Peaks contest are being put up. A poster celebrating Norma as
a past Queen is leaning against the podium. SHELLY JOHNSON and BOBBY BRIGGS
rehearse on stage.
BOBBY
Shel, I know I haven't been paying the right kind of
attention to ya lately But when I saw that old guy
kissing you ... something snapped. It's when I realized what
I had or something. And I want to dedicate my time to
that.
SHELLY
(hopeful)
Sounds great to me.
BOBBY
(re her speech)
So let's try to get through the rest. And then we can
discuss it. Together.
Shelly peeks at her speech, sighs, and continues her recitation:
SHELLY
"Yes, I believe there are so many beautiful things in the
world that should be admired and be thankful for. For
example, Detroit auto makers reported a record year of
sales for sports cars."
(she stops)
I don't know, Bobby.
BOBBY
What's wrong now?







SHELLY
Well, for one thing, nowhere in this entire speech do we
mention ecology, or forests, or anything.

Bobby looks at the speech.
BOBBY
I don't know where I'd put it. The speech is so damn
tight as is.
SHELLY
But it's supposed to be about that.
BOBBY
Shel, you're gonna be wonderful. You'll win in a walk.
And then we are off. Fade out on Twin Peaks. Fade up
on Hollywood insider games. Sunset strip. Easy
street, baby. Just like you always wanted.
(steps back from her, examining her)
Maybe a new hairdo. Or some signature makeup. We
got to mesmerize.
Shelly sighs. Apology or not. He's hopeless.
ACROSS THE ROOM
LANA BUDDING stares nervously at her fellow contestants. MAYOR MILFORD hurries
into view, sits beside her.
MILFORD
(he tries to kiss her, she turns away)
I've got great news. It's going to be Norma Jennings and
Richard Tremayne. Tremayne is the third judge. It's in
the bag.
LANA
I have to be sure. I want to be sure that I'm going to win.
MILFORD
My god, the guy's British - or Bahamian. He's bound to
fall for your charms.
(snuggling closer)
We'll find a chance for you two to be alone. Wear one of
those dresses of yours with the slit cut half way up to
Seattle.

Nestle up to him real close and when he gets a look at
those gams of yours and smells that French perfume

Oh, god, stop it. Oh, you vixen, stop it. I can't take it
anymore, why can't we elope and LANA
Not till I've won. Then and only then will I marry you.
MILFORD
You're so strict, darling,
(mumbles to himself)
And I am the g.d. Mayor!
It's no use. Lana will not be dissuaded. Milford takes head in hands.


INT. GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

CUT TO:

DOC HAYWARD finishes giving BEN HORNE a physical. Doc is purring his stethoscope
away and Ben is buttoning up his shirt. Both are tense.
BEN
The insurance company's sent me so many forms I could
get a heart attack lifting them.
DOC
You're fine. It's what in your heart that you should
worry about.
BEN
I know you have reason to doubt me. But I am only
interested in doing the right thing. For the good of
everybody.
Doc takes a long look at Ben. He believes him.
DOC
Then stay away from Eileen.
BEN
I can't. Not as long as the lie survives.
DOC
Dammit, Ben. It isn't that simple. I believe you. I
applaud your desire to do the right thing. But goodness
in you is like a timebomb. And there's nothing good
about ruined lives.








BEN
(kind, yet determined)
It is a confusing and difficult process. But I must
continue. I'm sorry, Will.
Wheeler sticks his head in the door as he knocks.
BEN
(happy for the interruption)
Jack! Come in. You know Will Hayward.
Wheeler is obviously upset. For the first time unsure. He tries to be polite.
WHEELER
I met your daughter the other day. Beautiful girl.
DOC
I think I should get back to the office. Nice to see you,
John. Ben, be careful please.
Doc goes out. Ben motions to the chair in front of the desk but Wheeler is in too much of a
hurry.
WHEELER
Ben, I've been trying to find Audrey.
BEN
She should be back any minute.
WHEELER
(blurting it out)
I've got to go, Ben. They're gassing up the jet as we
speak.
BEN
Well, give her a call when you get to wherever it is you're
in such a hurry to get to.
WHEELER
Ben, a friend of mine, well, more than a friend, a partner,
was murdered last night.
Ben reacts with evident concern. Wheeler takes a chair and tries to relax.
CUT TO:





 INT. GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - DAY
Audrey moves through the lobby, tired but excited from her trip to Seattle. The clerk behind
the desk sees Audrey.
CLERK
Ms. Horne. I have several messages...
Just then: Deputy Hawk appears, intercepts.
HAWK
Audrey. Agent Cooper would like to see you at the
Sheriff's station.
AUDREY
Oh. Well, I have a lot of work to do, but maybe this
afternoon
HAWK
Now. It's important.
Audrey pauses to wonder. Then walks with Deputy Hawk toward the door.
 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO:

Wheeler explains his problem. Ben is panicked. Both seated on the office steps.
WHEELER
Ben, I have to leave.
BEN
Of course, of course.
(then weakening)
But what about Stop Ghostwood? How do I get a hold
of you? I need more time.
WHEELER
A brave man is dead. My friend. And now I have to
take his place.
BEN
(getting it)
You're not coming back. Damn this rain forest business
anyway. Why can't you...? Sorry, sorry. See? I'm
already backsliding.
WHEELER
You'll be fine without me.






 
BEN
(scared)
I don't know. I feel disarmed. I'm afraid that I'm weak.
WHEELER
Ben Horne? Weak? I find that very hard to believe.
BEN
Strive for goodness. Tell the hardest truth first.
WHEELER
Do the best you can. That's all any of us can do.
Ben sighs, offers his hand. They shake and then hug. Then get to their feet.
BEN
Goodbye, John. I'm sorry Audrey wasn't here.
WHEELER
(pulling letter from jacket)
Giver her this. Tell her I...
BEN
(taking letter)
Good luck. Come home soon.
Ben watches Wheeler walk out the door.
 EXT. WOODS - DAY

CUT TO:

Briggs walks through the woods, dog tired but enjoying the solitude and nature. He stops to
inspect a particularly beautiful Douglas Fir. He runs his hands up and down the bark trying to
remember something. He fingers the tattoo behind his head. From behind him he hears
singing. He turns to see a COSTUME HORSE strolling down the path towards him. He
stares at it, stunned. The horse stops singing. Looks it Briggs.
HORSE
Hello, Wilbur.
A hand comes out from under the costume and a dart/tranquilizer whizzes out hitting Briggs
who wobbles away from the horse. He makes it about ten feet then topples over. The horse
stands over the downed pilot. Briggs desperately tries to focus on the horse head as it bends
over him.
BRIGGS
What... what?






 
Earle takes off the horse head.
EARLE
Long time no see, Briggsie.
He turns to Leo who stumbles about in the ass end of the costume.
EARLE
Leo, I think you have finally found your calling.
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

OPEN ON the three pieces of paper forming the poem. Cooper is placing them together.
Shelly, Audrey, and Donna sit across from him.
COOPER
Each of you received a part of this poem. And each in a
curious manner. Along with an invitation.
AUDREY
We all went to the Roadhouse but nobody showed up.
COOPER
In the past few days have any of you had contact with a
stranger? Someone that sticks out as peculiar or
charming or just plain puzzling.
DONNA
(after a beat)
Well, there was that weird guy that claimed he was a
friend of Dad's.
SHELLY
The same day I got my poem I got a ten dollar tip for a
cup of coffee. That was pretty peculiar.
AUDREY
And there was a funny old guy at the library. He asked
me to read it to him.
COOPER
(confirming his suspicions)
All three.
(sliding the poem in front of Shelly)
Take a closer look, Shelly. Does the handwriting seem familiar?






 
SHELLY
(beat, a gasp)
It's Leo's.
Cooper steels himself against the enemy.
COOPER
Listen carefully. I want you to check in with the Sheriff
two times each day. Nine in the morning. Nine at
night. Parents are to know your whereabouts at all times.
When you walk to school, when you drive to work, I
want you to make sure that you do not do so alone.
(beat)
Please believe me when I tell you to be very careful.
You are in danger. We all are.

 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

CUT TO:

START CLOSE on the mysterious black box, now open, sent to Catherine Martell.
CAMERA PANS, reveals the slightly smaller box found inside. Unlike the original, this
box has a finely filigreed lid, the twelve signs of the zodiac inscribed on its surface. A
HAND enters frame, pushes the zodiac signs. The filigreed squares give slightly, suggesting
that the correct combination will open it.
CATHERINE'S VOICE
(over latter)
His servant woman, what's her-name, Jones, delivered it
shortly after he died.
ANDREW
Eckhardt's last request. A clever jape, perhaps. Or
something of value..?
(seeking a way to open)
Try the hammer.
CATHERINE MARTELL and ANDREW PACKARD hover over the boxes. Catherine
ignores Andrew, presses the zodiac signs with increasing frustration.
CATHERINE
Won't work. There's a secret to opening each box, and
this one...
(exasperated, shoving the box away)
... is about to drive me mad.
Catherine pauses, seems about to hurl it through the nearest window. She turns to her brother.
CATHERINE
Tell me some good news, Andrew. Anything.
ANDREW
(fascinated by the black box)
Our foreign investors are chomping at the bit, from Paris
to Beijing. You'll get your golf course, Catherine. Right
next to the Great Northern Hotel.
CATHERINE
Ben's doing everything he can to stop us.






 
ANDREW
He's too late. When the project was still in his
possession, Ben cleared every possible hurdle. Zoning,
impact statements. He was, and is, his own worst
enemy.
Andrew's focus shifts palpably to the mysterious box. He pushes the zodiac buttons, tries
different combinations.
CATHERINE
As always. What...?
ANDREW
Nothing, dear. Just trying a few simple combinations
Let me.

CATHERINE

Catherine tries to get at the second box, but Andrew will not give way. The mysterious gift
inspires a possessive mania in both.
ANDREW
One minute, Catherine. Eckhardt's birthday, my
birthday, I know, the date the gift arrived...
(the box springs open)
CATHERINE

Give it to me.
(grabs the box, peers inside)
Not again.
She withdraws a third black box, a little smaller than the last. Andrew doesn't hesitate:
I opened it.

ANDREW

Andrew snatches the third box. And, before Catherine can intercede, sets it upon the table,
grabs the hammer, and strikes it as hard as he can. The box splinters, opens. Catherine shoves
Andrew aside, reaches into it...
CATHERINE
(hopes dashed yet again)
Oh, Andrew...
... And pulls out a fourth and final box. Small and slender, stainless steel. As mysterious as
the rest. Catherine and Andrew pause to gaze at it, wonder what secrets are harbored inside.
CUT TO:






 INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
The sun makes its way through the cabin's window.
EARLE'S VOICE
When did you first see the symbol in Owl Cave?
An ARROW flies through the air, sticks deep into a brightly colored target. And just inches
from Major Briggs, bound upon it. Windom Earle stands at a near distance, holds out his free
hand for another arrow. Leo, subdued by his recent beating, complies. But when Earle turns
back to Briggs, Leo's eyes follow him with newfound mental vigor. He's beginning to reclaim
his senses.
BRIGGS
(brave to the last)
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
EARLE
(playful, insane)
Cheater.
Earle lets fly another arrow, pinning Briggs right trouser leg to the target. And, judging by
the spot of blood that appears, piercing some part of his flesh as well.
EARLE
What does the cave painting mean?
BRIGGS
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
EARLE
Damn, but I love the military mind!
Earle fires another arrow, this one strikes the target just inches from Briggs' ear.
EARLE
(with fervor equal to the previous questions)
What's the capital of North Carolina?
Raleigh.

BRIGGS

Earle extracts an ampule of amber liquid from his jacket, then a syringe. He draws the liquid
into it.




 
EARLE
Major, I admire your fortitude. Had I the time and the
patience, we might continue this game indefinitely.
However...
Earle jabs the syringe into Briggs' chest with sudden violence.
EARLE
...I have neither.
(turning back to Leo)
Catch.
Earle tosses the empty syringe at Leo. Leo dodges it. Earle turns back to Briggs. The drug
takes hold quickly. Briggs struggles deep within a narcotic haze. Earle whispers, he means to
test the drug's effect.
EARLE
Your name, please.
BRIGGS
Garland... Briggs.
EARLE
Garland, what do you fear most in the world?
BRIGGS
The possibility that love is not enough.
EARLE
Garland, please. I shall weep. How much does your
wife weigh?
BRIGGS
One hundred and fifteen pounds.
EARLE
Good for her. Now, when did you first see the
hieroglyph in Owl Cave?
BRIGGS
In...in dreams.
EARLE
What kind of dream?
BRIGGS
I went night-fishing with Agent Cooper. There was a
bright light, the guardian beyond it. I was taken, but my
mind...still I recognize the signs...








 (2)
EARLE
What do the signs mean?
BRIGGS
(fading fast)
There is a time ... if Jupiter and Saturn meet ... they will
receive you...
A tremor ripples through Briggs. He begins to babble.
BRIGGS
Taht mug uoy ekil si gnimoc kcab ni elyts... Taht mug
uoy ekil...
EARLE
Oh, Garland. I was hoping for a lengthy conversation.
(turning away)
Leo. Put the Major to bed. I'm afraid his mind has
begun to wander.
Leo steps to the target, removes the ropes that bind Briggs to it. Earle pauses to remember the
last words he told him.
EARLE
There is a time... if Jupiter and Saturn meet...
Earle ponders as he repeats with delight.
 INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO:

START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected
upon it. Just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.
NADINE'S VOICE
...and this is me with last year's regional champion from
Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!
The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them,
about to slam his hand on the mat to signal "pin".
ANOTHER ANGLE
NADINE stands, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the
couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY
runs the slide projector. Nadine continues, blissfully unaware:






 
NADINE
And this is me with Brock Farmington, Triple A
champion from Spokane. Unbeaten in eighty previous
matches, superior upper body strength, thighs like bridge
supports ...
(a little sigh, sometimes it's too easy)
I pinned him in a minute five. Next!
One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.
NADINE
And this is me with all the stuff I won.
Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.
NORMA
Congratulations, Nadine.
MIKE
(the enthusiasm of the sexually sated)
Way to go, babe!
Nadine leaps upon couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it
close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the he resulting foursome.
JACOBY
(to all, but to Nadine in particular)
Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
couple contemplates divor (catches himself)
- er, breaking up, it is sometimes. easier to talk about
our feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe
you would like to begin.
NADINE
Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed
Mike's buns in the hall at school.
JACOBY
And...how are you feeling now?
NADINE
(toying with Mike's hand as she speaks)
Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean because I'm so
happy and I worry about Ed being sad.
JACOBY
Ed, are you sad?







 (2)

No.

ED
(god knows he's confused)

JACOBY
Nadine. How does that make you feel?
NADINE
It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
past behind us.
It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming
kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:
JACOBY
Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
Nadine?
ED
(clears throat, takes the plunge)
Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.
A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:
NADINE
Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
are getting married too.
That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens
in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.

 INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Audrey steps into her father's office. Ben rises from his desk, hurries to greet her.
BEN
Audrey! Welcome home!
Ben takes Audrey into a warm embrace. But Audrey has other things on her mind.
AUDREY
I got back this morning. But Agent Cooper wanted to
see me, so BEN
(genuinely, instantly concerned)
Is anything wrong?
AUDREY
Some creep sent me a poem. Daddy, have you seen
Jack? I called his room but nobody answered.
BEN
While you were away, I had the most incredible
brainstorm.
AUDREY
(expecting an answer, Wheeler)
What...?
BEN
(grabbing a carrot from his humidor)
The Stop Ghostwood movement needs a spokesperson,
someone with a highly visible profile to inspire our
community to action.
AUDREY
Daddy, where's Jack -?
BEN
(man on a mission)
You can do it, Audrey. As Miss Twin Peaks you can
become that spokesperson, you can use your public
platform as a forum for environmental debate, you,
Audrey, and only you, can take our message to the
people.
AUDREY
(young woman on a different mission)
Ben. Where is John Justice Wheeler?!






 
BEN
(not insensitive, merely refocused)
Oh. He's gone.
Gone?!

AUDREY

BEN
(checking his pockets)
Yes. Tragic, isn't it? Some tragedy in Brazil demands
his immediate attention. He left you a letter, I have it
here somewhere...
AUDREY
When did he leave?
BEN
(finds the letter)
Just now. The airport.
Audrey snatches the letter from Ben hands, and races out the door.
BEN

pageant is tomorrow!
Too late. Audrey's out the door.

 EXT. BLACK LAKE AIRPORT - DAY
Near sunset. A taxi sporting the sign "Tim and Tom's Taxidermy" and bearing a huge set of
antlers on its roof rolls up to the lone jet on the runway. A voice is heard inside the taxi:
VOICE
Straight... hold... steady... stop.
The taxi jerks to a stop in front of the jet. A piece of luggage falls to the runway, followed by
Wheeler, who pulls himself to safety from the back seat where TIM PINKLE sits. His blind
brother, TOM, sits behind the wheel in the front seat. Wheeler stares at the blind man. Tim
explains his brother.
TIM
He loves to stuff, and he loves to drive. Otherwise he
sleeps.
WHEELER
Well, I am very glad to have the opportunity to be
thankful for arriving here.
TIM
The pleasure is half mine.
(pointing to the antlers on the hood)
Remember, we'll stuff anything.
Right.

WHEELER

Tom shouts to Wheeler as he moves towards the jet.
TOM
Welcome to Twin Peaks.
The taxi pulls away under the direction of Tim's voice- "Right, easy, right again, straight."
 INT. SHERIFF'S STATION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

The war room atmosphere pervades. Cappy poring over maps. A computer screen and
terminal. And Deputy Andy standing before the blackboard, peering intently at the
mysterious hieroglyph.
Cooper and Truman share cups of coffee. Cooper peers at Briggs' calculations, sheafs of paper
covered with figures and notations.





30A.

 
COOPER
The symbols suggest a time. That much is clear.
TRUMAN
A time for what?
COOPER
(pausing to glance at hieroglyph)
I'm not sure. At first I thought the hieroglyph was a
signpost. But what if it's an invitation instead?
Or both.

TRUMAN

COOPER
Exactly.
(checking his watch)
Where is the Major?
TRUMAN
He should be back by now.
(spotting Andy by the blackboard)
Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call. See if the Major's home.
Truman turns back to Cooper, seees him looking off into the distance, preoccupied. The
Sheriff assumes the usual brainstorm, wonders:
TRUMAN
What it is, Coop?


 
COOPER
(to the point, even now)
I was thinking about Annie Blackburne.
TRUMAN
(with affection)
I've never known your mind to wander.
COOPER
It's strange. I've been feeling this way all day. I
proceed as usual, mind clear and focused. And then,
suddenly, out of nowhere, I see Annie's face, I hear her
voice. Naturally, I attempt to reorient myself, return to
the task at hand. But her image remains. Sometimes I
feel dizzy.
TRUMAN
(faint regret)
Looks to me like a man in love.
COOPER
My symptoms suggest the onset of malaria. Yet I've
never felt better in my life.
Cooper looks at Truman, his sad expression. Love has torn him apart. And Cooper knows it.
COOPER
Sorry. I sound foolish.
TRUMAN
No you don't. You sound lucky.
HOLD ON Cooper for a beat. Lucky indeed.

jet, shouts up at the cockpit.
AUDREY

Jack Wheeler's face appears in the cockpit window, grinning from ear to ear. He vanishes.
Audrey races around to the exit door. It opens, the stairs unfold. Wheeler appears in the open
doorway.
WHEELER
(as the stairs touch ground)
I should have known a simple goodbye was out of the
question.
Audrey runs up the stairs into his arms. They kiss for a very long beat. Finally, Audrey looks
into his eyes. No quips, no flirtation, no barrier between. Just the simple truth.
I love you.

AUDREY

WHEELER
I love you too.
AUDREY
Do you have to leave?
Yes.

Couples dance to a slow country waltz on the jukebox. A banner proclaims: MISS TWIN
PEAKS, OUR 20th ANNIVERSARY. Several contestants are visible throughout. A
stagehand sets up a microphone on the stage. Annie sits at the bar. She sips from a soda, looks
about. She's waiting for someone. Annie reacts, peers at the dance floor.
Cooper stands amidst the dancing couples. He gestures for Annie to join him there. Annie
demurs. But Cooper insists. He won't budge. Finally, Annie smiles, slides off the barstool,
and steps into the dancing crowd.
ANNIE
I'm not completely prepared for this.
COOPER
Think of it as a walking embrace. Two people stepping
as one would step.
Annie slides into his arms. A perfect fit.






 
ANNIE
So far so good.
COOPER
Now follow me.
ANNIE

(wry)
We'll follow each other.
Cooper and Annie take tentative steps about the dance floor.
Steady.

COOPER

ANNIE
Two people stepping...as one would step.
COOPER
(pleased)
You've got it.
ANNIE
Genetic memory. Mom and Dad danced the Lindy.
Cooper and Annie find a gentle dancing rhythm, their bodies close together. A beat.
COOPER
I like the way your body feels against my body.
ANNIE
I was thinking the same thing.
COOPER
If I'm too forward...
Annie surprises him with a kiss. They settle more deeply into each other's arms. Then, quietly:
ANNIE
I want more than your kisses.
For instance?
I...

COOPER
ANNIE

Suddenly: the music STOPS, a voice intrudes, shattering the spell.

MILFORD'S VOICE
Hello? Is this on...?
Mayor Milford stands on the Roadhouse stage, taps at the microphone. All turn to face him.
MILFORD
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our
final night of festivities celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks
pageant. As many of you already know...
The microphone SQUEALS, a little puff of smoke drifts past the Mayor's nose. He looks
about, addled, taps at the mike again.
MILFORD
Damnation. Is this on...? Hello...?
The microphone is dead. A STAGEHAND scuttles into view, attempts to replace it.
Meanwhile, Annie quietly confesses, eyes straight ahead:
ANNIE
What I mean is, I understand why you treat me with
care. Why you hesitate. The convent evokes images of
helpless women fearful at the thought of emotions other
than those derived from scripture and prayer.
(choosing her words carefully)
But when you hold me, when we kiss, I feel safe and
eager. I'm not afraid. Not of anything you make me
feel. Or want.
Cooper turns to her. They kiss for a long beat. Once again, Milford intrudes:
MILFORD'S VOICE
It's on? About time. Hello...? Welcome to our final
night of festivities celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks
pageant.
(muttered)
Oh, hell. Where're my cue cards?
(on mike)
Hello? Welcome to our final night...
COOPER
(without anger)
I'm beginning to tire of his interruptions.
ANNIE
(safe in Cooper's arms)
I don't know. He's cute.
(beat, sudden impulse)
I think I'll enter after all.

COOPER
The Miss Twin Peaks contest?
ANNIE
Why not? Local girl returns to strive for her crown. It's
like a fairy tale.
COOPER
And you, its Queen.

Cooper and Annie embrace in the middle of the dance floor. Slow motion FX. Cooper looks
over Annie's shoulder, reacts. Music up. The GIANT steps slowly between dancing couples,
arms spread, as if to welcome or warn. Cooper's circling steps take him in and out of view.
Cooper pauses, tries to focus. The Giant cannot reach him. Not this time. And then, as
quickly as he appeared...the Giant vanishes.

Wheeler's jet speeds down the runway, glides off into the night.

the next thing you know he's flying to Brazil.
PETE
He'll be back some day. He promised.
AUDREY
Sure. He promised to take me fishing and we never did.
Love stinks.
Fishing?

PETE

AUDREY
Yeah. Pearl lake or something.
PETE
I've got some tackle in the truck.
You do?

PETE
Audrey, there are many cures for a broken heart. But

Yes. You may.
Audrey takes his arm. HOLD ON Pete and Audrey as they walk back to the truck.

 INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT

CUT TO:

The cluttered interior of Earle's cabin. Earle's three Queens, Audrey, Shelly, and Donna posted upon the wall. Briggs handcuffed to a chair, mumbling incoherently. Leo held fast by
his leg chains. Earle works feverishly, referring to the Owl Cave hieroglyph on his computer
screen, a series of maps, open books before him. The books are astrological in nature, various
charts and planetary configurations. Just now: Earle completes his computer rendering of the
Owl Cave hieroglyph.
EARLE
(giddy incantation)
If Jupiter and Saturn meet, oh what a crop of mummy
wheat...
Leo watches Earle closely. He seems more alert with each passing moment. And sympathetic
to the Major's plight. Earle addresses him, teacher to pupil, gesturing to the hieroglyph.
EARLE
The planets that our babbling Major spoke of, are more
than distant orbs. They are, in fact, a clock. A clock
that tells a time. And the time...?
Earle looks to Leo for the correct response. Leo says nothing.
EARLE
The time draws nearer with each ticking tock. Dale
wasn't far wrong, the cave painting is an invitation of
sorts, telling us when the revels begin. But what Dale
doesn't know, is where to find it.
Earle's fingers dance across the computer keyboard. Calling up two squares upon the screen.
The hieroglyph. And a map of Twin Peaks.







 
EARLE
For you see, the cave painting is not only an invitation...

Earle taps instructions, watches as the two squares move closer upon the computer screen until
superimposed atop each other.
EARLE
...it is also, a map. A map to the Black Lodge.
CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. It's a perfect match. A beat. And the two images
begin to vibrate, almost imperceptibly. Earle leans closer. Music up. The images vibrate
faster and faster, the superimposition has unleashed dark magic. Earle smiles, delighted.
Begins to LAUGH. Leo holds his hands to his ears, pained by sound only he can hear. The
vibrations reach a fever pitch and... the computer SPUTTERS and goes BLACK. CAMERA
MOVES RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE DARK SCREEN...
CUT TO:

 EXT. MONTAGE/ WOODS - NIGHT

Suddenly: a series of IMAGES, fast-paced, accompanied by the appropriate music, the
sounds of owls, raging wind.
JOSIE screams, trapped within the drawer pull.
CAMERA POV races madly through the woods, headed toward the Black Lodge.
Then, in an instant, quite jarringly - SILENCE, a grove of trees, the air still and calm. An
eerie beat. An ARM coalesces in midair, inch by inch, now reaches about testing the cool
night, fingers prodding. The wind begins to rise. Satisfied, the arm recedes, disappears.
A beat. BOB'S disembodied HEAD follows. Fierce winds blow, shaking the trees with
mighty force. Bob's floating head peers about, now snaps back into a feral HOWL. Then Bob
VANISHES in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
The winds recede. All is calm again. Save for the patch of SCORCHED earth below.
THE END

INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
LEO JOHNSON and MAJOR BRIGGS sit captive against a wall. Leo slowly looks around
the room. Does so again. Apparently satisfied , he rises to his feet and moves until the ankle
chain snaps him to a halt. Straining forward, he is able to lean over a table, and takes
something from its drawer. He then returns to beside Briggs, who still looks very dazed,
unconscious of his surroundings. Leo, with great effort, fits his new possession into the lock of
Briggs's handcuffs. Briggs is released. But doesn't realize it. Leo shakes him.
LEO
Save Shelly ...
Leo is looking up at the wall with Shelly's photo. Enough internal fog clears for Briggs to
realize he is now free. He gets up unsteadily and stumbles away. CLOSE ON the wall
photos.



SAME PHOTOS - LATER

MATCH CUT TO:

SOUND of a door closing. Footsteps. EXPAND TO show WINDOM EARLE coming in
to see Briggs is gone.
EARLE
Why, who in the world let Major Briggs loose, Leo? It
couldn't have been you, could it?
Leo cringes, expecting another shock. None comes.
EARLE
No, no punishment little Leo. It's to late for that to
do us any harm. And I have a new game for you.
He holds up a burlap bag. Something's moving inside.


CUT TO:

INT. DINER - DAY

Over by the kitchen, SHELLY and ANNIE are sorting silverware, when they're joined by
NORMA, who carries over a tray of freshly baked pies.
NORMA
Here's our contribution to the Miss Twin Peaks Gala
Buffet. And I fully expect to see one of you up there
tonight in the winner's circle.
ANNIE
Dream on, Norma.









NORMA
Don't sell yourself short, kid. This is one of the biggest
days of the year for us and we need somebody up there
who deserves that title. Especially this year.
ANNIE
... Laura Palmer.
NORMA
A day of healing and coming together.
SHELLY
We could use more than a day.
(pause, then)
Norma, is it true they're going to honor you tonight?
Twentieth anniversary of when you won?

Hush.

NORMA
(playful)

SHELLY
If you entered you could win today.
NORMA
Listen to her, working on the judge already.
SHELLY
Since you brought it up ...
ANNIE
Good question: who are you going to vote for?
Ahelly and Annie put an arm around each other and present a united front.
ANNIE
Maybe they'll let you split your vote.
NORMA
(laughing)
We have a customer.
ANGLE ON DALE COOPER entering the diner. It's clear whose customer he is: to
Shelly's intrigued glance, Annie walks over toward the counter.
COOPER
Looks like a staff meeting of the Double R brain trust.
ANNIE
We're trying to decide who's going to win tonight.








(2)
COOPER
No question about it. You are.
ANNIE
You're not exactly objective COOPER
I am completely objective.
ANNIE
(softly flirtatious)
I think you're not as objective as you think you are.
COOPER
Perhaps that's why it seems so important to me that we
kiss.
ANNIE
(affectionate, not shy)
You impetuous boy. We have an audience.
COOPER
I know this violates multiple laws of physics, but at his
moment, Annie, and I mean this quite literally... you are
the only person in the room.
Annie beams. They lean across the counter to kiss. Shelly and Norma look on, smile, look
away.



INT. GREAT NORTHERN - DAY

CUT TO:

AUDREY HORNE stands pensively, her face half-lit by the fireplace glow. BEN HORNE
enters, arms filled with books they nearly obscure him. Audrey manages a smile.
Hi, Daddy.

AUDREY

BEN
(pausing by the fire, nearly losing hold of a
tome)
Audrey. The most intelligent face I've seen all day. You
make the rest of us look like primates.
AUDREY
What's with all the books?










BEN
(listing each and every one)
The Koran, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud, the Bible,
New and Old Testaments, the Tao-te-ching ... I have in
my arms those holy books that constitute the fundamental
framework of man's philosophies of good. Somewhere in
here are the answers I seek. I intend to read them, cover
to cover until find ...

Audrey's attention has wandered back to the fire. Ben Finally stops rambling, sees the sad
expression on her face.
BEN
Listen to me, prattling on. It's Jack, isn't it?
AUDREY
He's only been gone a day. I ask myself how much will it
hurt next week?
BEN
Let me give you a piece of ageless wisdom culled from
these volumes: time heals all wounds.
(she starts to reply)
I know what it feels like. Believe me, I know. He'll be
back.
AUDREY
We barely had time to realize how we felt ...
BEN
But what you had was highly concentrated.
AUDREY
It's the concentrate they make concentrate from.
(sigh)
I'm afraid I'll never see him again.
BEN
Jack's a man of his word. If he said he'll be back, he'll be
back, I promise you.
AUDREY
(moved)
You can't promise. But thanks for wanting to. I actually
came in here to update you on my Seattle trip.
BEN
(closes the book)
Update away.







(2)
AUDREY
(slowly turning her mind to business)
The Packards are using Twin Peaks Savings and Loan to
funnel cash for the Ghostwood Project, but the bank's
keeping a very low profile. They don't want the bad
publicity.
BEN
Bad publicity is exactly what they're going to get.
Audrey, have you given any more thought to the Miss
Twin Peaks pageant?
AUDREY
Daddy, from the bottom of my heart, I don't want to be
the town bathing beauty.
BEN
Audrey, Miss Twin Peaks is the ultimate local forum. It
would be truly inspirational to have a winner with a
political sensibility that extends beyond makeup
strategies and recipes for cherry pie.
(the Horne twinkle)
And as you know, each contestant makes a speech to the
asembled town. This year's theme concerns our
immediate environment. And what we must do to
preserve it.
HOLD ON Audrey for a beat. Considering brand new strategies.
AUDREY
Maybe I'd better take a look through those books myself.



INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONFERENCE ROOM

CUT TO:

START ON the cave painting reproduced on the blackboard: a cluttered concentration of
various symbols, stick figures, stars, hieroglyphs. PULL BACK to ANDY BRENNAN
standing myopically close to this drawing, staring at it with his own personal brand of awe.
Cooper and TRUMAN, looking sleepless, re-enter the room carrying their coffees.
COOPER
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?
TRUMAN
Not today.
(Andy's beat; moving on)
We've still got people out combing the forest for Major
Briggs.







COOPER
Harry, given their mutual connection to the Blue Book
Project, I'm afraid Earle may have targeted the Major.
For what?
Interesting.

TRUMAN
ANDY

They look over at Andy, who is still completely engrossed in the painting. Cooper and
Truman are in proximity to the bonsai tree.
COOPER
I don't know yet. All of this appears to be flowing
together. Earle's been seeking access to the Black Lodge
as far back as 1965. This chess game may involve more
pieces than we'd begun to imagine. And then there's the
peculiar circumstances of Josie's death to consider.
TRUMAN
Consider them how?
COOPER
When Josie died ... I'm sorry I haven't mentioned this
before, Harry, but I had to take into account your mental
state What is it?

TRUMAN

COOPER
She was trembling with fear. Quaking, like an animal. I
might even venture a guess to say that it was fear that
killed her. And in the moment of her death ... I saw Bob.
As if he'd slipped in through a crevice in time. Upon
reflection, I believe there's a connection between his
appearance and Josie's fear. He was attracted by it. He
may even feed off it.
TRUMAN
You see any connection between Bob and the Black Lodge?
COOPER
I think it's where he comes from. I believe the Black
Lodge is the source of what you've traditionally referred
to here as the evil in the woods. If that's what Earle is
seeking, it's imperative that we find our way in before he
does. There's a source of power in that place far beyond
our ability to comprehend.
CUT TO:









INT. WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN
Windom Earle, listening in on his shortwave set, springs out of his chair in excitement.
EARLE
Eureka! Dale, I could kiss your pointy little head. It's
fear! It's fear, Leo, that's the key!
(begins packing one of his silver briefcases)
My favorite emotional state and all this time it's been
staring me in the kisser. Leo, it's marvelous, a
perfect fit. These night creatures that hover on the edge of
our nightmares are drawn to us when we radiate fear, it's
their bread and butter, a perfect symbiosis. And to gain
entrance to their realm, a simple offering, the suffering of
innocence, Oh, nature, perfect in design and aspect, you
do not disappoint. Leo, look lively, victory is at hand.
We know where the entrance is. We know when the lock
appears and now we hold the key in our hands.
He takes the photos down and packs them, then closes the suitcase. He lifts the other case.
EARLE
Forgive my hasty departure, dear one. But the time has
come to gather my beloved Queen and embark upon our
dark honeymoon. I haven't been this excited since I
punctured Caroline's aorta.
(beat)
Leo, we must share a final sentiment ...
We still cannot see Leo.
EARLE
During our time together in this verdant bower, I must
confess I've developed something of a fondness for you.
Sounding board, companion. Ever obedient and faithful.
An all-around "A" for effort, Leo. Though I'm still a
trifle miffed at your release of Major Briggs. But then
You'll have plenty of time to reflect upon that, won't you?
Goodbye, Leo. And good luck.
As he goes, we PAN DOWN to Leo, who is very tightly shackled. He is holding the end of a
string taut in his mouth. We FOLLOW the string directly above his head and see that it is
holding a large suspended plastic bag shut. Inside the bag are dozens of deadly spiders.

FADE IN:


INT. ROADHOUSE - DAY
A line of Miss Twin Peaks contestants in black dance leotards rehearse the opening number.
They include, amongst some faces we do not know, DONNA, Shelly, Annie, LUCY,
Audrey, NADINE and LANA. Standing before them, sleeves up, a cigarette bobbing in his
mouth, is the impresario and choreographer, the ubiquitous TIM PINKLE. The piano player,
TRUDY, jumps back into a show tune and the girls begin their chorus line dance.
PINKLE
Okay, one and two.. and three...
(doing the moves with them)
Step forward one and over and two....
The girls continue on their own as Pinkle steps over to a table and takes a large pull off his
submarine sandwich.
PINKLE
(through his chewing)
Let the mood carry you... don't be afraid to be
vulnerable... and give me just a little more leg...
(beat)
Now bend forward, like sap in the... er, sapling in the
wind... a little further... very good... hold it for me... then
up... and out.
The song ends. Audrey eyes their trainer warily.
PINKLE
You girls'll need a lot of work...
(belch)
...but if you stay with it, I think I can make dancers out of
you.
(taking her aside)
Especially you, Miss Horne.
AUDREY
What kind of dance was this, Mr. Pinkle?
PINKLE
A nature dance, my little friend. A celebration.
AUDREY
What are we celebrating when you have us all bending
over?
PINKLE
Don't question the vision of your choreographer. You're
but a petal on the rose.








DONNA
(aside to Shelly)
Later it'll be the pistils and the stamens.
LUCY
Pistils and what?
SHELLY
(ruefully)
Don't ask.
NADINE
We're on stage at last. That's all that matters.
ANNIE
This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.
LANA
I think it't just the greatest thing that ever happened.
PINKLE
(moving back)
Once more with feeling, girls. I only have three things to
say: energy, energy, energy.
ANGLE OFF them over to a booth where the three judges, Norma, TREMAYNE, and
Milford sit watching, and discussing.
TREMAYNE
If talent's to be any part of our deliberations, we'd best
close our eyes until Pinkie's done wrecking havoc.
MILFORD
(entranced)
I love a chorus line.
NORMA
(beat, a look at them both)
If we can focus here for a second, I have to get back to the
diner:
(back to the printed agenda of their discussion)
"What qualities do we think best examplify Miss Twin
Peaks?"
MILFORD
Beauty and power.
(drawing their look)
That's how I like 'em.







(2)
TREMAYNE
Poise. And... God help us... sophistication and breeding.
NORMA
I think a major factor should be originality.
TREMAYNE
Wouldn't that fall under talent?
MILFORD
Always nice when it does.
TREMAYNE.
Personally, I've always been big on style.
NORMA
That should be enough to work with. I'll make up the
score sheets this afternoon. I've really got to go.
Terrific.

TREMAYNE

She goes. Milford eyes Tremayne. Business time.
MILFORD
Score sheets, shmore sheets. We're set on this, aren't we
Dick?
Set on ... ?

TREMAYNE

MILFORD
She looks lovely today, doesn't she?
TREMAYNE
If looks could kill ...
(off Milford's hrumph)
Sorry Insensitive of me.
MILFORD
She'd make a great Miss Twin Peaks.
TREMAYNE
Wouldn't she just. But my vote is of course something I
hold sacred and will exercise with the greatest care and
consideration. As you well know, being a man who's been
charged with the awesome responsibility of running this
town.








(3)
MILFORD
(Still negotiating, voice lowered)
Alright, I can give you three hundred, but not a penny
more.

Lana, as if on cue (and quite possibly so), comes over. Milford signals her over Tremayne's
shoulder.
LANA
(silkenly)
Hello, Dick. We're on break.
H-hi, Lana.

TREMAYNE

LANA
Do you think you could help me find something in the
storage room?
TREMAYNE
The storage room.
LANA
We're missing a very important prop.
The Mayor signals his approval to Lana.


CUT TO:

INT. STORAGE ROOM

All light comes from the hall. Two silhouettes enter. She shuts the door, closing them into
DARKNESS.
TREMAYNE
I'm having trouble.
Just flick it.

LANA

A moment. His flashlight goes on. Its light nervously scans the little room.
TREMAYNE
Now, what exactly did you need to find?
The flashlight goes off
Lana?...

TREMAYNE








LANA
Oh, did I do that?
The flashlight goes back on.
TREMAYNE
(a wreck)
What are we looking for?
LANA
I don't know the exact, technical name for it..
TREMAYNE
Well, does anything in here look like it ...
The flashlight goes off.
LANA
I think this might be it.
TREMAYNE
Oh. By George, I think you've got it.

 INT. GREAT NORTHERN/COOPER'S ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

Cooper sits crosslegged on the floor, perfectly still, eyes closed: he is deep in meditation.
Slowly he opens his eyes. Holds for a moment, takes a deep breath. Smiles broadly. Still
crosslegged, he reaches over and flips on his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, it's 1:15 PM. I've just concluded my second
meditations of the day in lieu of sleep. I am completely
refreshed and struck again by the realization that we all
live at a fraction of our potential. We've been working
round the clock on the cave hieroglyph. I know the
answer is in that crude etching and I am now convinced
that Windom Earle is searching for the same thing we are,
and for diametrically opposite reasons. If I'm correct in
my assumptions about the power of that unholy place ...
God help us if he gets there first.
Cooper pauses, clearly shaken by the implication. Then, quietly:
COOPER
I want to make specific mention of Annie Blackburne.
Diane, she is a completely original human being. Her








 
COOPER 
responses are as pure as a child's. To be honest, I haven't
felt this way about anyone since Caroline. It's taken
meeting someone like Annie to realize how gray my life
has been since Caroline's death, how cold and solitary A knock on the door. Cooper rises to answer it.
COOPER 
Although occasionally there is something to be said for
solitude.
He flips off the recorder, opens the door. Annie stands before him. He admits her.
COOPER
You have nearly perfect timing.
ANNIE
That's not what our choreographer says.
COOPER
What can I do for you, Annie?
ANNIE
I have to give a speech in six hours. I haven't written a
word and I don't have a thought in my hand. I am in a
complete, sweaty-palmed panic and I needed to talk to
someone, namely you.
COOPER
What's the topic?
ANNIE
"What You Can Do to Save Our Local Forests." So what
am I supposed to do, stand up there like a deranged
Barbie Doll, "make sure you're campfires are completely
out, kind of like my brain."
COOPER
You're I terrified of public speaking.
Yes.

ANNIE

COOPER
(amused)
Our forests need saving because of the way people regard
them.






 (2)
Expendable.

ANNIE

COOPER
If the Ghostwood development were going to cost
thousands of lives, would it have even the slightest chance
of going forward?
ANNIE
Trees aren't the same as people ...
(answering herself)
But they're alive.
COOPER
(extending the metaphor)
Your forest ... is beautiful and very peaceful.
ANNIE
Part of it's been damaged. I've tried to replant, but
nothing's taken root ...
They kiss. Tentatively at first. Then with greater fervor.
COOPER
Let's not talk anymore about trees.
ANNIE
To be honest, that's not really why I'm here. The speech.
COOPER
The way I feel transcends metaphor. Obliterates it.
ANNIE
How do you feel? I mean, usually. I only ask because ...
well, actually, I want to know.
COOPER
(an analytic detour)
My habit is to construct and control my emotions with
great precision. Everything ordered and in its place.
What I am feeling now has steamrollered every barrier
I've ever, if you'll excuse the expression, erected. I don't
know what I know or don't know. I only know ...
(happily jumbled, he sighs)
I want to make love with you, Annie. That's all I know.
Good.

ANNIE






 (3)
COOPER
Do you feel the same...?
Annie begins to unbutton her blouse. A gentle ritual.
ANNIE
(beat, she removes her blouse)
I am eager ... and full of grace.
COOPER
That's good enough for me.
Cooper reaches for her. HOLD ON Annie and Cooper for a long beat. As they begin to
make love.


INT. HURLEY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected
upon it. just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.
NADINE'S VOICE
... and this is me with last year's regional champion from
Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!
The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them,
about to slam his hand on the to mat to signal "pin".
ANOTHER ANGLE
NADINE seated, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the
couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY
runs the slide projector. Nadine continues, blissfully unaware:
NADINE
And this is me with Brock Farmington, Triple A
champion from Spokane. Unbeaten in eighty previous
matches, superior upper body strength, thighs like bridge
supports...
(a little sigh, sometimes it's too easy)
I pinned him in a minute five. Next!
One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.
NADINE
And this is me with all the stuff I won.
Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.







NORMA
Congratulations, Nadine.
MIKE
(the enthusiasm of the sexually sated)
Way to go, babe!

Nadine leaps upon the couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it
close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the resulting foursome.
JACOBY
(to all, but to Nadine in particular)
Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
couple contemplates divor (catches himself)
- er, breaking up, it is sometimes easier to talk about our
feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe you
would like to begin.
NADINE
Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed Mike's
buns in the hall at school.
JACOBY
And... how are you feeling now?
NADINE
(toying with Mike's hand as she speaks)
Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean Mike and I are
hot. Miss Twin Peaks is tonight and Mr. Pinkle thinks
I'm a show business natural. I mean because I'm so happy.
I worry about Ed being sad.
JACOBY
Ed, are you sad?

No.

ED
(god knows he's confused)

JACOBY
Nadine. How does that make you feel?
NADINE
It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
past behind us.
It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming

kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:
JACOBY
Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
Nadine?
ED
(clears throat, takes the plunge)
Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.
A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:
NADINE
Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
are getting married too.

That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens
in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.
CUT TO:

 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE

START CLOSE ON dirtied shoes, footsteps stumbling up a ridge with great difficulty. Up
a step, then another, then sliding down: the attempt to climb by a body that must struggle just
to keep balance.
 INT. RANGER TRUCK
HAWK drives a country road. SHOT ROTATES away from him until we look out the
windshield, where SUDDENLY.
A MAN steps out into the road, groping, arms extended skyward; he has no sense he's
stepping out in front of a vehicle. As Hawk CAREENS and SLAMS on the BRAKES, he
watches the zombi-like face of Major Briggs passing by.
Hawk pulls over gets out of the jeep and walks over to Briggs, who clearly does not recognize
him.

Still very disoriented, Briggs sits across from Truman as Cooper rushes in.
TRUMAN
I waited for you.
COOPER
Thanks, Harry.
TRUMAN
Not that he's too talkative.
A beat on Briggs.
TRUMAN
He checks out okay physically. Doc ran a blood test ...
COOPER
He's been shot up with haloperidol.
Right.

TRUMAN

COOPER
Garland ... did Windom Earle do this to you?
BRIGGS
Garland. What an odd name ...
COOPER
Was it Windom Earle?
BRIGGS
(shrugs)
He was God, I suppose.
COOPER
Where did he take you?
The woods?

BRIGGS

COOPER
Can you be a little more specific?
BRIGGS
They were lovely, dark and deep.








 
BRIGGS 
(to Cooper)
The King of Romania was unable to attend.
Hopeless. Cooper and Truman pull away.
COOPER
This might take awhile.
TRUMAN
How much time have we got?
Andy enters, and without a word, walks straight past Briggs and up to the cave painting.
COOPER
Not enough. Let's leave him in here with us. Maybe
something will bubble up. Harry, we're in trouble. If the
door to the Black Lodge does exist, it probably exists
only in time. An object like a door normally exists at a
point in space and time. By way of contrast, a shooting
star exists for us at a point in time over a continuim in
space, but looking at it from the star's point of view
might be an entirely different experience.
TRUMAN
Sorry, you lost me.
COOPER
If we're not at the right place at exactly the right time
we'll never find the way in.
Sheriff?...

ANDY

They both look over at Andy, who remains fixated on the drawing.
ANDY
Could the 4H Club have anything to do with all this?
TRUMAN
Doubtful, Andy.
Andy continues staring. Cooper stands.
COOPER

Harry, you'll have to excuse me. I left someone waiting
in the other room.

I'm sorry about this. I mean work. Having to be here
instead of ... you know ...
ANNIE
Guess this isn't a good day to fall in love.
COOPER
It's a great day. I'm just not used to feeling such discord
between my professional and personal concerns.
ANNIE
I'm not used to feeling what I feel right now either.
COOPER
Like a force of nature.
ANNIE
I think I may have found the inspiration for my speech.
COOPER
I think we may have found a lot of things ...
ANNIE
Don't say too much. You don't want to jinx us.
COOPER
No. I just don't want to lose you.
ANNIE

Go back to work. My heart will start beating again when
next we meet. My knight in shining armor.
He smiles. Watches her go. Hooked.

 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
The room is spread with power tools, hand tools, gloves, soldering irons. PAN UP to a
counter converted into a work bench, and on to a vice containing a small black box. Standing
around the clamp are CATHERINE MARTELL, ANDREW PACKARD and PETE
MARTELL.
ANDREW
This has to be the last one. Look at it.
CATHERINE
I can't take any more of this. Boxes inside boxes...
What's in there could be worth a fortune.
ANDREW
Maybe it's not a box at all. Maybe it's just a block of
stainless steel.

Eckhardt's last little joke.
PETE
Be a good one.

On three. One.. two... three.
Pete paratroops down off the counter, with his whole body weight against the vise bar. Andrew
yanks down on his shoulders, but one hand slips free, causing Pete's vise grip to loosen for an
instant, sending both Pete and Andrew to the floor behind the counter. Andrew stands back up
and yanks the box free of the vise and throws it to the floor in front of Catherine.



 




ANDREW
(yelling)
The infernal box. It's heinous. It is slowly driving me
mad.
CATHERINE
Oh, good, Andrew, perhaps if you yell long and loud
enough it will open by itself.
ANDREW
Do you have any better ideas, Catherine?
Pete pulls himself back up from behind the counter using the handle of the vise for balance. He
comes back down on the vise, which slams shut against Andrew's hand.
Packard SCREAMS.
PETE
Sorry, Andrew.
Pete loosens the vise, freeing Andrew's left hand. The man is in indescribable pain. He looks
down at his hand. Pain instantly turns to rage. He pulls out a gun we didn't know he had.
Pete's eyes bug out.
CATHERINE
What are you doing? He didn't mean it...
Where's it?

ANDREW

CATHERINE
Where's what?
There it is.

ANDREW

The tiny box. Halfway across the room. Andrew fires. It flies. He fires again. And again.
Andrew, no!!

CATHERINE

And again. And again. He puts the gun down.
ANDREW
Damned boxes.
Pete comes out from behind the counter and walks over to the far corner of the room, into
which are lodged the box's remains.





22A.

 (2)
PETE
Well, look at this.
They come over. Three people are bending into a tiny comer. They rise. In Pete's hand is a
key.
A key.

ANDREW

CATHERINE
Where there's a key, there's a lock.
ANDREW
This should be kept safe.
CATHERINE
(with a suspicious look at Andrew)
And in plain sight.
PETE
You two don't trust each other?
A look at Pete. Then each other.
CATHERINE
Of course we do.




 (2)



ANDREW
Like brother and sister.
CATHERINE
How about here.
(to the desk)
Under this bell jar. On the desk. In plain sight.
ANDREW
Splendid.
(she places it there)
So ... we have a key.
Yes. We do.

CATHERINE

She sits down beside the desk. Andrew sits on the other side of the desk. A beat. They'll
wait each other out. Pete, watching all this, shakes his head and walks out.
 INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO:

Donna comes down the stairs in a black sequined gown, hair and makeup meticulously done.
She enters the living room where Doc and EILEEN HAYWARD gaze at her proudly.
DOC
(a trace wistful)
You look truly beautiful.
EILEEN
Read us your speech.
But Donna's expression reveals a completely different agenda.
DONNA
Right now, I'd prefer to talk about the truth.
EILEEN
What truth is there?
DONNA
Something is going on between you and Ben Home. I
want to know what it is.
DOC
Donna, don't talk to your mother that way DONNA
This isn't child-parent. This is eye-to-eye. I want to
know. Now.







 
EILEEN
Donna, I understand your feelings. There are things you
have to trust in. You're young and you don't see any
limitations DONNA
I now the limitations of lies. I know you raised me to
tell the truth. I expect the same from you.
Pause. Eileen and Doc look at each other, agonized.
DONNA
If you won't tell me, I'll have to find out what I want
from Ben Horne.
No ...
Then tell me.

EILEEN
DONNA

Silence. Eileen looks away.
DONNA
Understand. This is your choice, not mine. And you've
made it.
She heads for the door. Doc comes to his feet.
Donna -

DOC

But she is gone.
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

Deputy Andy brings fresh coffee into the conference room. He pauses to resume his
contemplation of the cave painting on the blackboard. Andy sets down the coffee, moves even
closer. Truman and Cooper confer nearby. Cooper has surrounded himself with various books
and charts. He finds something.
COOPER
Andy, take a look at this: it's what you mistook for the
4H Club; the 4 and H are astrological symbols ANDY
You mean like planets?



 



COOPER
Yes, they're the symbols for Jupiter and Saturn. Some of
these other symbols are planetary as well. What this
paticular part of the puzzle seems to signify is a specific
planetary position: Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction.
TRUMAN
What's that supposed to mean?
COOPER
Historically, when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct, large
shifts occur in power and fortune. Jupiter is expansive in
its influence; Saturn, contractive. Conjunction suggests a
state of concentration, intensification. What we have
indicated here is something potentially explosive.
(mind racing)
Taking into account the earth's rotation, planetary
positions are specific down to the last second ...
(searching through books)
... and according to the Ephemeris, taking the other
planetary positions on the wall into account, this
conjunction will occur in our part of the world ...

His finger stops. Cooper looks up. Surprised, concerned.
When?

TRUMAN

COOPER
Tonight. At midnight.
(an intuitive leap)
My God, Harry, the door to the Lodge, that's when it
opens. That's what the puzzle's telling us.
BRIGGS
Protect ... the Queen ...
COOPER
(hyperfocused)
If the door is open tonight then something else here must
tell us where. We need to decipher the rest of this,
immediately. Think, anything that looks familiar ...
They look intently.
BRIGGS
Fear and love ... open the doors.
COOPER
What did he say?







 (2)
TRUMAN
He said "Fear and love open the doors."
COOPER
(another flash)
Two Lodges, two doors. Fear opens one, the Black.
Love, the other.
TRUMAN
What does that mean?
COOPER
I don't know exactly. It just came to me.
BRIGGS
(a looped smile: Hamlet)
"How does the Queen?"
Cooper and Truman exchange looks. Cooper's on a roll.
COOPER
Of course: the Queen.
Romania?

TRUMAN

COOPER
No. The chess game's final piece. Follow my thinking.
Earle takes the Queen ...
TRUMAN
The game's not over until you take the King.
COOPER
That depends on where he takes her. Maybe he takes her to
the doorway when it opens ...
TRUMAN
Which Queen are we talking about?
Andy, as if psychically awakened by this climate of collective revelation, suddenly goes
dumbstruck. For the first time, he looks away from the board, over at Cooper and Truman.
ANDY
Agent Cooper ...
COOPER
Not now, Andy. Tonight ... the Queen. But who? A
Queen. A crown ...







 (3)
ANDY
Agent Cooper?
COOPER
Miss twin Peaks.
Oh my God.

TRUMAN

The two of them spring from their seats.
ANDY
Agent Cooper, please Andy comes over, crying to get their attention, and knocks over the Bonsai plant. Truman
respectfully kneels to pick it up, and discovers...
TRUMAN
This plant... has a bug.
He pulls out and holds up the electronic device.
COOPER
This Bonsai wasn't from Josie. It was from Earle.
(doomsday pronouncement)
He's way ahead of us, Harry. And we've been working for
Earle from the start. What time does that conest start?
Any minute.

TRUMAN

COOPER
We've got to hurry.
They bolt for the door. Andy, ignored, calls after.
ANDY
Agent Cooper!!
FADE OUT:
END ACT THREE


ACT FOUR




FADE IN:
 INT. ROADHOUSE/STAGE - NIGHT
BEGIN ON the exuberant, concentrated expression of Nadine as she lands to the downbeat.
TRACKING SHOT of the other contestants, who all form a chorus line in their leotards and
dancing pumps. A small band plays the opening number as we INTERCUT amongst the
girls: Audrey's detachment, Shelly's enjoyment, Donna's preoccupation, Annie's awkwardness,
Lana's sultriness, Lucy's disorientation, Nadine's hopefulness, and the enthusiastic, nameless
faces of others. INTERCUT through the audience, showing the three judges, Norma,
Tremayne and Milford, the troubled Doc Hayward, the inebriated Pinkle, then finally
PANNING OVER to where the LOG LADY stands, watching.
The number ends to generous applause. Doc Hayward pauses in the wings, staring at Donna,
hoping garner her attention. But she stares ahead, will not meet his gaze. Hayward steps to
the microphone. He's got a lot on his mind.
DOC
Good evening, everyone. Hope you've all had a good
holiday. And welcome to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,
in which one of these lovely, talented young citizens will
be crowned Miss Twin Peaks.
(applause)
Now, commencing the talent segment of the show is Lucy
Moran.
Lucy steps forward, to the piano intro of Off Broadway. She looks awkwardly into the
audience, shrugs, then breaks into a jazz dance that is shockingly good. The stagelight narrows
to enclose her.
Backstage, BOBBY BRIGGS, tomorrow's superstar, wanders about in a loose-fitting suit
scoping out the crowd for possible opportunity. Not much. At a distance, he sees the Log
Lady and shakes his head.
BOBBY
Strictly small-town.
Turning his head in another direction, he then sees... the Log Lady. He quickly turns back to
the prior spot: no one. Thoroughly confused, he marches on over to the second Log lady, who
is standing off in a corner, working quietly and efficiently at a power junction box.
BOBBY
Excuse me.. did you invite family to this thing?
The question is met with a deep stare. Suddenly the Log Lady hefts her log, CRACKS Bobby
across the head, knocking him over, and out. CLOSE ON the 'Log Lady' until we can see,
behind her glasses, the eyes of Windom Earle.
CUT TO:





 STAGE - LATER
Doc Hayward returning to the microphone.
DOC
Our next entry is Lana Budding-Milford, who will
perform a dance of..
(checking his card)
... contortionistic Jazz exotica. Lana?
Lana steps forward, to some recorded sensual Near East rhythms.
 INT. ROADHOUSE ENTRANCE

CUT TO:

Cooper and Truman hurry into the Roadhouse. Already planning, eyes scanning the crowd for
trouble.
TRUMAN
We're pulling in deputies from all over to surround the
place. They should be here within the hour.
COOPER
It's essential that whoever wins this contest receive full
police protection: 24-hour guard, house surveillance,
everything.
TRUMAN
Soon as she's announced.
Truman heads one way, Cooper the other. HOLD SHOT as Andy now arrives, frustrated.
ANDY
Agent Cooper...
 STAGE

CUT TO:

... as Lana swings into the beginning of some overpowering rhythm stretches.
INTERCUT:
 AUDIENCE REACTIONS
Hawk and Andy stand in awe of this exhibition. Trying to follow Lana's movement, their
heads slowly, simultaneously tip in opposite directions.
In the judge's booth, Tremayne's mouth hangs open. Milford leans in close to him.






 
MILFORD
That, my friend, is an artist.
Tremayne is close to tears. PAN over to Norma, forehead in hand.
CUT TO:

 AUDIENCE - LATER

Cooper moves carefully through the crowd, eyes right and left. Then he pauses, looks up. And
spots a catwalk overhead. He pauses to wonder. Then turns his eyes back to the stage.
DISSOLVE TO:

 STAGE - LATER
Audrey in the middle of her pageant theme speech.

AUDREY
There is only one way to save a forest, an idea, or
anything of value: and that is by refusing to stand by and
watch it die. There is a law of nature which is more
fundamental to life than the laws of man. And when
something you care about is in danger, you must act to
save it, or lose it forever.
(beat)
And that is what I, as Miss Twin Peaks or as Audrey
Horne, intend to do.
Applause.
CUT TO:

 BACKSTAGE

Andy, continuing his search for Cooper, happens upon the still disguised Earle.
ANDY
Hello, Miss Log Lady.
No reply. Earle is just hoping he'll go away.
ANDY
Have you or your log seen Agent Cooper? I've got to find
him.

No.

LOG LADY (EARLE)
(murmurs)

ANDY
What was that?








 

NO.

LOG LADY (EARLE)
(hoarsely)

ANDY
Oh. Sorry. It's just that I've got to find Agent Cooper as
soon as possible. Maybe you could ask your log to be
extra, on guard ...
The Log Lady/Earle stomps away. Andy looks after, puzzled, frustrated. Something's not
quite right. He spots someone across the room.
ANDY
(back to the races)
Agent Cooper.
Andy races off. CAMERA REMAINS. And reveals what Andy just missed. A siren horn
attached to the backstage wall, new wiring, a timing device. Carefully installed by Windom
Earle.
CUT TO:

 STAGE - LATER
Annie giving her speech.

ANNIE
... and to illustrate my point, I'd like to read these words
from Chief Seattle, leader of the Suquamish tribe:
"Your dead... are soon forgotten and never return. Our
dead never forget the beautiful world that gave them
being. They still love its verdant valleys, its murmuring
rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered vales and
verdant lined lakes and bay and even yearn in tender, fond
affection over the lonely hearted living, and often return
from the Happy Hunting Ground to visit, guide, console
and comfort them."
A hush has fallen over the crowd. She folds up her paper.
 CUTAWAY - CATWALK
Windom Earle, now undisguised, darts along the catwalk overhead. He attaches another device
to a sandbag line, sets the timer. That's when Annie's voice catches his attention from below.
Earle pauses, peers down at her with rapt expression.


 BACK TO SCENE



ANNIE
Why have we all lost touch with this beauty? We tell
ourselves the world is not alive so that we won't feel its
pain. But instead we feel it all the more. Maybe saving a
forest starts with preserving the little feelings that die
inside us every day. Those parts of ourselves we deny.
Because if that interior land is not honored, then neither
will we honor the land we walk. Thank you very much.

She walks off to a salvo of applause. INTERCUT to show Cooper, who has been conferring
with a deputy, pausing to watch her exit with evident emotion. And Tremayne, who looks
swept away, and finally ... Windom Earle, in the catwalks above.
INTERCUT:

 EARLE'S POV

His careful psychopathic eye SCANS the row of ladies, pausing a moment on Shelly; then
Donna, and Audrey. We then PAN over to, and HOLD on, Annie.
 BACK TO SCENE
Doc Hayward walks back on the stage.
DOC
Thanks to our contestants. The balloting will now
commence and we will then announce our winner.
CUT TO:

 BACKSTAGE
Lucy has succeeded in pulling aside Andy and Tremayne.
LUCY
Have you both forgotten what day this is?
The two men look at each other. The answer seems too obvious.
ANDY
Miss Twin Peaks Day?
LUCY
Today is the day my unborn child receives a father
TREMAYNE
It was right on the tip of my tongue.
LUCY
I have decided that regardless of which individual is
biologically responsible ...





 




LUCY 
(looking into Tremayne)
... that I want Andy to be the father of my child.
Both men attempt to digest this. Tremayne is tremendously relieved.
Really?

ANDY

LUCY
I'm sorry, Dick, but I have to do what's best for little
what's his name.
TREMAYNE
Not at all. A sound choice. Heartiest congratulations,
Andrew. Now if you'll excuse me, I do have a vote to
cast myself ...
(his signature smile)
Here's to the children.
He goes. Not quite the moment Lucy expected. She glares after him.
LUCY
Don't sound so disappointed.
ANDY
(remembering)
My God Lucy, I am so honored you made this decision
and I promise I will be a great father, but right now, I
have to find Agent Cooper.
He runs off. Lucy remains standing there.
Men.

LUCY

 ANOTHER PART OF BACKSTAGE

CUT TO:

Donna searches for, spots and approaches Ben Horne. Her emotions are near the breaking point.
DONNA
I want to know what's going on between you and my
mother.
BEN
(sincere, aware of others looking on)
Donna, I believe the wisest course would be for all of us
to sit down together and talk this out.



 
NO.




DONNA

BEN
(trying to comfort)
Donna DONNA
Old pictures and Horne bearer bonds in the attic. Love
letters to my mom.
BEN (overlapping)
Donna, I want to tell you the truth. I want to do the right
thing DONNA
A birth certificate with no father's name on it. What the
hell is going on, Mr. Horne? Why won't anyone tell me
the truth?!?
Tears form in Ben's eyes. Stunned, silent, overcome. He reaches for her. At that moment she,
knows.
BEN
Donna your mother and I ...
DONNA
Oh God. You're my father.
Donna runs away. Ben calls after, he doesn't care who hears.
Donna.
 STAGE

BEN
CUT TO:

The girls stand in a line back near the curtain as Doc Hayward speaks into the microphone.
DOC
It's now time to make the announcement. The winner of
the contest and our new Miss Twin Peaks, is ...
(opens a paper and reads)
Annie Blackburne.
Congratulatory screams of other contestants, who now hug the startled Annie. On the floor, the
crowd reacts with generous applause. Cooper freezes, understands the danger she is in. Alert,
he looks about the Roadhouse, determined to protect. Cooper remembers the catwalk, his
premonition. He looks up. Someone is standing in the shadows overhead. Windom Earle.
Cooper leaps forward. Meanwhile, an uproar from the judge's booth. Mayor Milford.



 




MILFORD
This is an outrage. She's been living in this town for about
fifteen minutes!
(to Tremayne)
What the hell got into you?
TREMAYNE
(very nearly genuine)
She gave a beautiful speech, inherent in her message were
words even the most craven among us can ill afford to
ignore MILFORD
She stole half of it off a dead Indian, she plagiarized that
speech NORMA
She didn't plagiarize, she quoted.
MILFORD
You voted for your own sister!
NORMA
And you voted for your girl friend!
 ON THE CATWALK
Cooper climbs up to the catwalk, hurls himself atop it. He draws his gun, looks ahead.
Windom Earle stands at the other end, grinning from ear to ear. As the pandemonium
continues below:
COOPER
Windom. Don't move.
Cooper takes careful steps along the catwalk, gun aimed at Earle's chest. Looking out for
traps, deadly surprises. Oddly, Earle says nothing, merely grins. A ghoulish apparition
positioned in the far shadows.
EARLE
Dear heart. You are, if nothing else, consistent. As you
have no doubt realized, our little game of fourdimmensional chess has concluded. And once, dear,
dim, Dale - you have left your Queen unprotected.
(a manic giggle)
Forgive me. I amuse myself. You see, twenty years ago I
made a promise. And tonight, I keep it ... in the Black
Lodge.
(whispered, antic)
Farewell. I must be going.







 
Earle holds up his arms to conduct an invisible orchestra. Then he slashes downward - and
SUDDENLY the lights go out. MUTED SOUNDS of little explosives going off: smoke
bombs. A COLORED STROBE LIGHT begins flashing, exposing in pulsations the growing
pall of smoke. A SIREN then starts wailing through the room. Screams erupt in concordance,
people are now scurrying about in panic. On the catwalk, Cooper races forward, lights
flashing, smoke obscuring... only to find that Windom Earle is gone.
On stage, pandemonium, the girls huddle in fright. A sandbag falls from above, LANDS on
Nadine's head. More pandemonium, screams. CLOSE ON Annie, her own acute fear.
Suddenly she hears a voice in the dark.
VOICE
(supernaturally gentle)
Don't be afraid. Let me help you.
A hand reaches out to her. Annie takes it, tentative. Once in its grasp, Annie is JERKED
forward. Face to face with her captor, Windom Earle. Annie tries to SCREAM. Earle whips
her away into the dark.
Cooper leaps down from the catwalk, now searching for Annie as well as his nemesis.
ANNIE!

COOPER

Suddenly: the siren STOPS. Chaos everywhere. Cooper fights his way through the crowd,
eyes searching. Annie is nowhere in sight.
Truman hurries over. Cooper stares out into the darkness, hopeless. The strobe dies. Smoke
is clearing.
TRUMAN
Everyone's okay.
COOPER
He took Annie. He took Annie.
TRUMAN
I'll get everybody on it. Bastard won't get half a mile
from here.
Truman moves off purposefully. Cooper continues staring out ahead. Andy arrives, at wit's
end.
ANDY
Agent Cooper, I've been looking all over, for you....
COOPER
Andy, they're going to need you outside.
ANDY
This is important, that cave painting in the office, I
finally figured it out.







 (2)
What's that?

COOPER

ANDY
I knew I'd seen it someplace before. I know where it's
telling us to go, it's not a puzzle at all ... it's a map.
Galvanized, Cooper stares at the unlined, boundless face of Andy Brennan.
FADE OUT:

THE END





ACT ONE
FADE IN:


INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Cleanup and commotion after the kidnaping. A smoky haze in the air. DEPUTIES clean up
the mess Windom Earle left behind.



INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Pageant GIRLS enter for questioning. They pass ANDY BRENNEN and LUCY MORAN
in mid-conversation.
LUCY
- and the lights went out. I kept thinking: The lights are
going out, the lights are going out and then they did and
it all went black. And then I kept thinking: What about
hand signals? What good would they do us now? And the
baby. What if the lights when out in hospital, and you
were in the elevator?
ANDY
Then I'd help you have that baby right there in the
elevator in front of God and everybody.
They kiss. Andy whispers romantically.
ANDY
It's a map, Lucy.
What?

LUCY

ANDY
I figured out that the puzzle was a map not a puzzle. I
solved the puzzle.
How?

LUCY

ANDY
Suddenly I saw all the pieces come together. It was sort
of like that old game show, "Concentration?"


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO:

COOPER hovers over the hieroglyph/map. HAWK and a second DEPUTY stand to the rear,









impassive. TRUMAN hurries to join them. More bad news.
TRUMAN
Earle got away. Nobody saw him or Annie. Sorry,
Coop.
COOPER
(hyperfocus)
We know it's a map, Harry, but of what?
(pointing)
The giant and the little man from my dream are there.
Are they telling us to go somewhere? Damn it, where?
TRUMAN
Maybe we should try to find Earle's cabin.
COOPER
That's not where, he is - there's no time.
PETE MARTELL busts into room. Furious and shouting.
PETE
Grand theft, Auto. The Log Lady stole my truck.
(beat)
68 Dodge truck. Powder blue like the dust kicked up at
sunset. I tried to run after it till I saw those beautiful tail
lights turn and head up the road towards COOPER
(it comes together)
The woods. Ghostwood National Park.
Truman looks at the map with new eyes. Instantly.
TRUMAN
Here's something, Coop.
(shows him something on the map)
Twelve trees in a perfect circle. There's a place like that
up in Ghostwood, it's called Glastonbury Grove COOPER
Glastonbury. That's the legendary burial place of King
Arthur.
PETE
King Arthur's buried near here?
COOPER
No, in England. This feels right, Harry, let's get up
there.








(2)
They hurry to the door. The Deputies fall into step.
TRUMAN
Hawk, get Major Briggs from the infirmary, and see if he
can help you find Earle's cabin.
COOPER
You'll find Leo Johnson there. Maybe he can tell us
something about Earle TRUMAN
(to second deputy)
Call the State Patrol, I want a dragnet in those woods
leading up to the Grove, then you meet us up there Cooper stops at the door. Edgy.
COOPER
Harry, I can't ask you to go.
TRUMAN
Stow it, Coop. Let's roll.
They exit.



CUT TO:

INT. HURLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

NADINE HURLEY blances a large ice pack on her head, mind thoroughly elsewhere.
MIKE NELSON escorts DOC HAYWARD to the door.
HAYWARD
Twenty minutes on, twenty minutes off. That should
reduce the swelling. Don't forget the aspirin.
Thanks, Doc.

MIKE

Hayward exits. Mike steps back to Nadine, settles on the couch beside her. Nadine stares
straight ahead, into the dim future.
MIKE
Does it hurt much, baby?

Who?

NADINE
(from another time and place)

Mike lifts the ice bag, gently kisses the growing knot on Nadine's head.









MIKE
I'm sorry you lost.
Who?

NADINE

MIKE

God, Nadine I was so worried about you. I admit there
were times when I had my doubts about what we meant to
each other, but seeing that sandbag hit you, I knew that
I'd practically do anything for you.
Who?

NADINE

MIKE
(deep breathe)
I love you. There I said it and I'm glad.
Mike gently cups her chin, turns Nadine's face toward him, offers a passionate kiss. But
Nadine pulls free, looks at him with complete surprise. And a palpable lack of recognition.
Who are you?
Mike.

NADINE
MIKE

NADINE
You try to stick your tongue down my throat and then, as
some sort of explanation, you say your name is Mike?
What the hell are you doing in my house, anyway?!
MIKE
You, you brought me here.
NADINE
Bullpucky. Take a hike, bozo.
Nadine swats at him. Mike braces for a powerful blow only to fend off a feminine slap. ED
and NORMA walk in the front door.
NADINE
Ed, get over here, this kid's trying to molest me.
(spotting Norma)
What's she doing here?





(2)



ED
(hearing a familiar tone)
Nadine?
NADINE
Put those muscles that aren't between your ears to work
and give this punk the heave-ho.

Mike, Ed, and Norma stare at her.
NADINE
(cold)
Norma, if you don't mind, Ed and I have business to talk
about. Not that it isn't just peachy to see you.
Nadine pauses to look around the living room. As if to see it for the first time.
NADINE
Hey. Where're my drape runners?
A beat. Ed steps forward. Gulp.
ED
Nadine, how old are you?
NADINE
What kind of stupid question is that?
ED
Humor me. How old are you?
NADINE
Thirty-seven, you moron.
ED
(weighing the possibilities)
Good answer.


EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Pete Martell's pickup is stopped on the side of the road.


INT. MARTELL'S PICKUP - NIGHT

CUT TO:

WINDOM EARLE behind the wheel studies a map of the forest. Next to him is ANNIE
BLACKBURNE.









EARLE
Glastonbury Grove. Should be right up that path.
(checks his watch)
Plenty of time.

He watches Annie come to from the chloroform.
EARLE
Hello, sleepy head.
(stares at Annie, makes a face)
Boo!

Who?

ANNIE
(jumps back)

EARLE
Think of me as cancer. Or a heinous virus. Something
you can die from - horribly.
(laughs)
I am about to cow you for your own mortification.
ANNIE
Windom Earle.
She turns away. Earle reaches over. Pulls her hand from her pocket. A rosary is in her hand.
EARLE
Oh, man, what a cheater! Sister Mary Holy Water crams
for finals.
(grabs the rosary and tosses it out the window,
slides closer to her)
Hey, you want to know something? Cooper's birthday is
April 19th, 195 That means his moon is in Aries. Get
it?
This is lost on Annie. Earle goes into a rage.
EARLE
You don't get it, do you, you pathetic little professional
shut in.
(quick mood change)
On the other hand, I've just spent two weeks in a cabin
with a smelly head of cabbage.
(grabs her)
Has anyone ever told you you look a lot better than Leo
Johnson? Smell better too.





(2)



ANNIE
(trying to be calm)
If you're going to kill me why don't you get it over with?
EARLE
Oh, we have much bigger plans than that, my pretty.

Earle reaches below his seat, takes out the Miss Twin Peaks crown and places it on her head.
He kisses her passionately. She struggles. Earle laughs.
EARLE
I tell ya, doll, if I was ten years younger and could find
the heater in this truck - boy, oh, boy. Having some fun
now.
He opens the truck door.
EARLE
Won't you join me for a gambol in the grove?
He drags Annie out of the truck, and into the woods.


EXT. ROAD IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO:

Truman's Cruiser skids to a stop behind Pete's pickup. Cooper runs to the truck, feels the
hood.
COOPER
Still hot. They're close.
TRUMAN
(into his radio)
Andy, we've found the truck, get the patrol up here I want
the search centered from where we are now.
(to Cooper)
There's a short cut to the Grove up through here.
Cooper checks his watch.
11:

COOPER

TRUMAN
(breaking out his rifle)
We still got time, Coop.
COOPER
(taking out his gun)
To fear the worst often causes the worst. He's going to










COOPER 
terrify her, Harry. He did it to me. It's what he did to
Caroline. Face to face with all that's intolerable. All
that is evil.
TRUMAN
(getting his bearings)
He can't terrify anybody with a bullet between his eyes.
(starts up)
It's this way.
COOPER
I'm right with you, Harry.



EXT. THE WOODS, GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Earle and Annie enter the circle of twelve trees. Then Earle circles her, stalking.
ANNIE
What are we doing here?
EARLE
A momentary pause in limbo, dear. Please be patient.
Pity young Dale will miss all the fun. I always felt we
were sort of Lodge Brothers.
ANNIE
He'll find you. He'll come for me.
EARLE
(screaming)
Do you see him anywhere? Huh? Huh?
Annie seems very calm, closes her eyes, whispers prayers to herself.
EARLE
Prayers? What a revolting development.
Earle checks his watch. Frustrated. She's not scaring.


EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Truman and Cooper move quickly along a path.
COOPER
Harry, all my skills, intuitions and dreams have led me









COOPER 
to the threshold of what is completely unknown. Led me
in a direction I never could really see. In spite of Earle's
prideful insanity. In spite of my best reasoning, only one
truth is clear. Whatever is, is right.
(stops, to his friend)
I'll take it from here, Harry. Alone. Cover me.
(before Truman's protest)
This is how it's supposed to be.
Truman stops. Realizes the truth of what he's saying.
Go. Go.

TRUMAN

Cooper races ahead.
 EXT. GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Earle and Annie in the dark grove.
EARLE
You and I have an appointment at the end of the world.
(railway conductor)
"Toot, toot, 'board." This where it ends and the fun
begins. Get ready for first class despondency and
madness. The bewitching hour looms brightly.
(Annie is frozen, glaring at him)
If only Young Dale had lived to see it.
ANNIE
He's not dead.
EARLE
Oh, Cooper's dead, alright. Gone and soon forgotten.
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Didn't I mention it? I
meticulously splattered his brains across the back of the
Roadhouse just before we left.
(chortles)
Poor studious little Dale. Never saw it coming. Not
even time for one of his pithy observations. You see, he
was too busy looking after you. Left himself wide open.
No... no....

ANNIE

EARLE
Same thing happened the last time, when he fell in love







 
with my wife (pulls out a knife)
I took the boy right to the edge that time, opened him up
like a zipper. Six months to put back all the pieces (Annie starts to cry, terror setting in)
Caroline, the unfaithful whore, she died quickly. Much
better than she deserved. Don't be so prissy. There's
nothing serious in mortality. Renown and grace come
afterward. In fact, they come right here. Here in this
place the nectar of life will be drawn.
Earle moves towards her. Annie screams, terrified. Behind her the doorway to the Lodge
begins to open, a hole in space. Earle is crazed with joy. A benediction.
EARLE
"I tell you they have not died. Their hands clasp yours
and mine."
Annie turns and seems to be trying to run away, getting nowhere.
 ANNIE'S POV

INTERCUT:

A kindly smiling MOTHER SUPERIOR NUN seems to welcome her ... Annie moves
towards her, sobbing ... the Nun turns into Earle, who grabs her by the wrists and pulls her
towards the gaping hole, just as ...
 COOPER
... runs into the grove.

INTERCUT:

 COOPER'S POV
Windom, not dressed in costume, pulls Annie through the hole.

Cooper runs to Earle, grabs his leg but it slips away and disappears into the hole.
 TRUMAN
... rushes into the grove. Too late. Only to see Cooper disappear into the hole and it closes
up after him.
TRUMAN
No... god... no.
FADE OUT:
END ACT ONE





ACT TWO
FADE IN:
 EXT. GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT
Truman stands alone in the circular grove waiting for what he doesn't know. Andy runs up
behind him.
ANDY
Agent Cooper ... Agent Cooper.
This scares the hell out of Truman. Andy notices the horse costume leaning against a tree.
Sheriff, look.

ANDY

TRUMAN
Stay away from that, Andy.
But Andy is already over there.
ANDY
No. No. There's a note in the horse's mouth.
Truman goes cautiously to him. Andy takes out the note and a net drops on top of him.
TRUMAN
(dripping)
What's the note say?
ANDY
(barely able to read in the tangle of the net)
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
 INT. EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT

CUT TO:

Leo the prisoner sits there with the string holding the bag of spiders. He tries to yell for help
and the string begins to slide through his teeth. He chomps down harder on it.
He tries something else. He slides the chair out from under him. It falls away but he has no
more room, has gained nothing. He is left in a squat with no support.
 EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY

CUT TO:


 INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY




Morning. ANDREW PACKARD tip-toes through the lodge to the mysterious key enshrined
beneath the glass bell jar atop Catherine's desk.
ANDREW
(sotto voce)
I've seen this somewhere...
Andrew has an idea. He rifles through the desk, finds a large ring of keys, tagged for easy
identification. Mill Office. Cadillac. Tool Shed. And last... Twin Peaks Savings and Loan. He
lifts the jar, fingers the key, holds it up for closer inspection, compares it to the first. Same
make, same model.
ANDREW
The Savings and Loan!
Just then: the sound of the kitchen door OPENING. Andrew tears the tag off the second key,
places it under the bell jar, [pockets the first. He looks up to see Pete, eyeing him with
disapproval.] And pockets the first. Andrew hurries out of the room. A beat. CATHERINE
enters, tip-toes like her brother toward the desk. She looks left and right, makes certain no one
is watching. Then gently lifts the glass bell jar.
[Oh, Andy...]

[PETE]
CUT TO:

 INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

DONNA HAYWARD carries a small suitcase into the living room, eyes red from crying.
EILEEN HAYWARD follows in her wheelchair.
EILEEN
Listen to me. Please.
DONNA
I've already heard enough. Okay, Mom?
EILEEN
But if you'd just let me explain Both pause. BEN HORNE stands in the center of the living room.
Donna.

BEN

DONNA
(to both, to everybody)
Leave me alone.
BEN
Donna, it's not your parents' fault. It's mine.




 

DONNA
(anger and contempt)
My parents? Who exactly is that supposed to be?
BEN
(to both)
I only wanted to do good. To be good.
(remembering Wheeler's advice)
Tell the hardest truth first. That's what I did. And it
seemed appropriate, it felt good to tell the truth at last.
(quietly)
But I was wrong. You were all better off when I devoted
my time to lying, cheating, and stealing. And as for
me...

Doc Hayward enters, weary, holding his medicine bag, and sees this tableau before him.
Hayward darkens.
HAYWARD
Oh, dammit, Ben...
BEN
Will, I have agonized and I have meditated and I have
prayed.
Ben, please.

EILEEN

HAYWARD
Donna, go to your room.
(to Ben)
Ben, I warned you. Get out of my house.
BEN
Can you forgive me, Will? After all I've done to you?
Forgive me. Please forgive me.
Ben steps to him, as if to embrace. Hayward grabs Ben by the lapels, forces him from the
room. Chaos follows.
Will!

EILEEN

HAYWARD
Leave my family alone!!
DADDY!

DONNA

Hayward shoves Ben toward the door. Ben reaches a hand toward Donna, desperate, as if her









 (2)
shout was meant for him. Ben falls, STRIKES his head on a coffee table. Donna SCREAMS.
Hayward kneels beside him.
HAYWARD
Oh, Lord...
(beat)
Donna, get my bag.
(she stands still, in shock)
DONNA!!
Donna takes one last look at Ben, the pool of blood forming beneath his head. And races from
the room. Eileen wheels closer, pales. Hayward kneels an prays.
HAYWARD
I'm sorry, Ben. My God I'm sorry. Ben, Ben can you hear
me...?
HOLD ON Ben's face for a beat. Silent.
CUT TO:

 INT. THE BLACK LODGE

START CLOSE on Agent Cooper, his face filled with wonder. He occupies a dark space,
limitless.
Annie?

COOPER

His voice echoes. No reply. Then a bright lights shines, and the GUARDIAN, cowled in
shadow, stands before him.
Where am I?

COOPER

A RIPPING sound. A FLASH of bright light.
SHOCK CUT TO:
 INT. MOTEL RECEPTION.
SUDDENLY Cooper finds himself in a shabby motel office, a raging wind outside,
slamming doors, shaking windows. At the reception desk, a CLERK, wearing a bizarre
orthopedic brace, a tracheotomy plug in his throat. The clerk speaks, as if to answer Cooper's
question:
Home.

CLERK






 
COOPER
Is this the Black Lodge?
CLERK
Name, please.
ANGLE ON COOPER
Suddenly ten years old. A smallish boy in shorts and shirt.
COOPER AS BOY
Dale Cooper.
BACK TO SCENE
The desk clerk nods, inscribes. Cooper has returned to his adult self. The change a flashing
metamorphosis, back and forth. Cooper reorients, reacts. The desk clerk has VANISHED.
An OLD MAN stands in his stead. Solid, kind in aspect and appearance. Cooper pales.
Father...?

COOPER

OLD MAN
There are fresh towels in every room.
COOPER
Father, listen to me. I need your help.
OLD MAN
Cable TV. Including three adult entertainment channels.
Please.

COOPER

OLD MAN
And a fruit basket with our compliments.
FATHER!

COOPER

A beat.
OLD MAN
You will need a key.
The old man takes a key from a rack, holds it out to Agent Cooper.
I love you.

COOPER

Cooper reaches out to receive it. He touches the key, and...
A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
THEN DARKNESS.

ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 EXT. WOODS - DAY
Major Briggs leads Deputy Hawk through the woods.
BRIGGS
(mystic memory)
I remember sunlight pouring through tall trees...
HAWKS
(looking for tracks, finding none)
A common sight in these woods, Major.
BRIGGS
(realizing)
I can smell it.
What?

HAWK

BRIGGS
The drug Windom Earle gave me has apparently
heightened my sense data. Shapes, colors, smells. I am
bombarded, and yet...it's as if my brain were better able
to interpret and define reality.
(pausing to consider, big grin)
Wow.
HAWK
You might want to have Doc runs some more tests when
we get back.
BRIGGS
No, no. I'm fine. I imagine this must have been what the
Sixites were like.
(heading out)
Follow me.
Briggs now trots through the pines, a man on a mission. His brain filled with bright new
information. Hawk follows.
BRIGGS
My God the flowers, can you hear them?
No.

HAWK

BRIGGS
The wind passing through their petals has a distinctive









 
BRIGGS 
quality quite different from the pine boughs above us.
Look. There we are. This way.
Briggs bounds into the distance.
CUT TO:

 INT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

Leo furiously works at the string in his mouth, trying to increase his grip on the lifeline. His
hands tug at the shackles, remain bound. Leo looks at the string with crossed eyes, sees that his
saliva is causing it to weaken and fray. Leo emits a little humming moan.
Suddenly: FOOTSTEPS outside the cabin. Hawk and Major Briggs charging forward. Leo
reacts, hopeful. The door BURSTS open, Hawk enters first, gun in hand. Briggs follows. Leo
can't help it, he sighs, smiles Hi -

LEO

(realizing his fatal mistake)
- WHAAAAAA!!
 EXT. EARLE'S CABIN - DAY

CUT TO:

The cabin exterior. Leo SCREAMING. The SOUND of Hawk and Briggs rushing to the
rescue. GUNSHOTS. More SCREAMING.
 EXT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

CUT TO:

Audrey takes determined steps toward the Savings and Loan, carrying a small black doctor's
bag.
 INT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

CUT TO:

Audrey steps through the interior. She is greeted by the Savings and Loan's unctuous manager,
DELL MIBBLER.
MIBBLER
Audrey. Horne. This is a welcome surprise...
AUDREY
(mind on her mission)
Morning, Mr. Mibbler.







 
Audrey walks right past him, toward the bank vault to the rear.
MIBBLER
(calling after)
Is there something I do for you? Miss Horne?
At the vault bars, Audrey sets down the black bag, digs inside it.
AUDREY
As a matter of fact, there is.

Audrey pulls a long length of chain from the bag, runs it through the vault bars.
AUDREY
I want you to call the Twin Peaks Gazette.
MIBBLER
Er, Miss Horne...?
AUDREY
Ask for Dwayne Milford Jr. He's the Editor.
Audrey wraps the chain around her waist, attaching her torso to the vault bars. She removes a
wicked looking padlock from the valise.
MIBBLER
Dwayne Milford Jr...
(snapping to)
Miss Horne, if I may ask a simple question AUDREY
(a rehearsed statement)
Tell him that Audrey Horne has chained herself to the
Twin Peaks Savings and Loan vault to protest their
financial ties to the Ghostwood Development Project,
and that she intends to stay here until a town meeting is
held to debate the future of our environment, and,
specifically, the effect of the Ghostwood Project upon it.
Audrey pauses to snap the padlock in place. She smiles at Mibbler.
AUDREY
Could you get me a glass of water please?
 INT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY

CUT TO:

Andrew steps through the interior, spots Savings and Loan manager Mibbler speaking
heatedly into a telephone. [Pete toddling along behind him. He spots Saving and Loan
Manager Mibbler speaking heatedly into a telephone.]

ANDREW
Dell Mibbler, as I live and breathe...

Mibbler looks up from the phone, blanches. His day goes from bad to surreal.
MIBBLER
You ... you...you ... you...
ANDREW [PETE]
Yes, Dell. It's me. Alive. [He's alive.]
MIBBLER
(sucking up despite insurmountable odds)
You look fabulous. And the funeral, well, the flowers, the
boy's choir, it...
ANDREW
I was hoping you could do me a small favor.
MIBBLER
(dazed)
Anything.
ANDREW
(pulling mystery key from pocket)
Does this look familiar to you?
MIBBLER
It's one of our safety deposit keys.
ANDREW
(stepping toward vault)
Shall we?
MIBBLER
(following)
Of course. There is one small problem...
Andrew [and Pete] stops short, sees Audrey chained to the vault bars.
ANDREW [PETE]
Hello, young lady. [Audrey.]
AUDREY
Hello. [Hi Pete.]
ANDREW
[Young lady, w]Why are you chained to the bank vault?







 (2)
AUDREY
Civil disobedience.

ANDREW
Ahh. "Waste no time arguing what a good man should be.
Be one." Marcus Aurelius. I admire your verve.
(to the harried bank manager)
I see no problem here...
(to Audrey)
If you'll excuse us, please?
Sure.

AUDREY

Mibbler sighs, reaches for a large ring of keys, opens the vault door. Audrey scoots forward,
allowing Andrew room to enter.
AUDREY
(to Mibbler)
Did you call the Gazette yet? The Sheriff too, probably.
Ask for Agent Cooper
Mibbler throws up his hands, mutters off. Audrey calls after.
AUDREY
And don't forget the water!
 THE BANK VAULT

CUT TO:

Andrew runs his hands along the wall of safety deposit boxes, finds the matching number. [Pete
worries at his side.]
[PETE]
[I'd feel a whole lot better about this if we let Catherine in]
[on our little secret.]
[ANDREW]
[(enjoying the pun, eyes on deposit box)]
[Oh, for Pete's sake. Isn't it time you stood on your hind]

[PETE]
[Frankly... no.]
[Inside the vault, Andrew sticks the key into the safety deposit box.]
CUT TO:




21A.

 INT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY
Catherine Martell hurries in the savings and loan entrance.
Inside the vault, Andrew sticks the key into the safety deposit box.
Catherine races toward the bank vault.
CATHERINE
Andrew!! You promised me!!
[Mibbler returns to Audrey with a glass of water.]
[MIBBLER]
[Miss Horne, is there anything I can do to convince you to]
[give up this doomed enterprise?]
[AUDREY]
[(takes the water)]
[Not really. Sometimes a woman's got to do what a]
[woman's got to do.]
[MIBBLER]
[But I'm still not certain exactly what it is you're doing.]
Andrew turns the key, OPENS the safety deposit box. A HISSING sound is heard. Andrew
is momentarily startled. He sees a note that reads: GOT YOU, ANDREW. LOVE,
THOMAS.
Audrey looks up [at Mibbler], sees Catherine running toward her. [flashes a winning,
memorable smile.]
SHOCK CUT TO:





 EXT. TWIN PEAKS SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY
The Savings and Loan EXPLODES, windows shattering outward, glass raining down upon the
sunny street.
CUT TO:

 EXT. WOODS - DAY

Truman sits on a rock near the circular grove, staring into the now-closed gateway, a mask of
determination. Andy approaches circumspectly. Pause.
ANDY
You sure you don't want anything to eat?
TRUMAN

No.

ANDY
'Cause I could call the diner they could bring something
out.
TRUMAN
If you're hungry, Andy, call. I don't want anything. I'm
not moving from here until we know where they went and
when they're coming back.

Okay.

ANDY
(pause; loyal and sad)

Andy wanders back down towards the cruiser. Truman continues to stare at the grove.
INTERCUT:

 TRUMAN'S POV
Near the center of the grove the air seem to shift shape, move and alter.
Truman stands, moves closer.

A GLEAMING WHITE SHIELD appears in the oscillating air and from behind it a hand
holding a SILVER SWORD.
Truman is mesmerized.
He now sees that holding the shield and sword is a tall, dark WOMAN, wearing a glittering
chain mail. She sees Truman, holds the sword out towards him.
TRUMAN
Oh my God... oh my God.





 
In a loud snap, image of the woman vanishes and we ...
CUT TO:

 A BLACK CORRIDOR

A dark, ominous version of the Great Northern. Everything in black and white, including the
checkboard floor. Cooper turns a corner and starts towards us, moving cautiously, glancing in
all directions.
Looking ahead, he sees someone approaching him. He moves closer and realizes it's a version
of himself, dressed identically, identical in every detail, but upon closer scrutiny realizes the
figure's face is smooth and blank, his eyes gleaming, lifeless and black as ebony, no white
cornea visible.
A door swings open to Cooper's left and another to his right. Looking through the left door he
sees Windom Earle far down a corridor, beckoning to him.
Looking through the right door he sees Annie.
Annie!

COOPER

The door SLAMS in his face.
CUT TO BLACK
END ACT THREE


ACT FOUR



FADE IN:
 INT. BLACK CORRIDOR
Cooper struggles with the door, can't open it.
WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
You're going about this all wrong, Dale.
Cooper stops, tries to locate the source of the voice.
WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
We'll profit not at all from resisting what there is to
experience here. That much I do know. Still, an entire
life of research and contemplation can't begin to prepare
one for the actual experience of being here.
COOPER
Where are we?
WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
Speaking for myself, I'm up here. No, up here.
Cooper looks up. Earle is floating ten feet off the ground some distance away.
EARLE
Think of us as astronauts. And when you do, think of us
fondly. I could hazard a guess at the physics but why
spoil the fun?
COOPER
What is this place?
EARLE
Where do you think we are, dummy?
COOPER
The Black Lodge.
Earle points the shock remote at him and presses the button: a burst of energy hits Cooper and a
loud BUZZING sound is heard.
EARLE
Good answer. I've always hoped my endless hours of
mentoring might CONTRIBUTE to the development
of a fertile MIND. You were such a dullard, Coopy, such
an earnest, plodding, do-gooding Eagle Scout - it was
all I could do sometimes to keep myself from







 
EARLE 
SHREDDING YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS OUT OF
GENERAL PRINCIPLE!
COOPER
(hiding his alarm)
You were too smart for me, Windom.
EARLE
Don't prostrate yourself, dear boy. You're a tool, a useful
one, granted, but it can't very well be said that we play in
the same league, now can it?
COOPER
You were always looking for this.
EARLE
That's right. And what were you looking for, in your
endless perambulations? Oh, I know all about those three
"missing years," Tibet and your pathetic eager-beaver
globetrotring quest for enlightenment. In that one respect
we aren't so radically different. Perhaps that's why I've
tolerated you for as long as I did. Because I knew that,
one day, you would prove useful.
COOPER
Useful for what?
EARLE
Why do you think, silly boy? For FUN.
He points the remote at him again and presses the button. A blinding flash of light.
CUT TO:

 INT. RED ROOM

Cooper comes to, lying on the floor of the red room. He rouses himself, looks around.
Hearing someone humming.
Where am I?

COOPER

A crude, hand-painted sign falls into view. It reads: PITTSBURGH, STUPID. The sign flies
up out of sight.
Cooper locates the source of the humming: a WOMAN in a pretty dress stands with her back
to him, at a sink in a small kitchen area.






 
COOPER 
Caroline ... oh my God ... Caroline?
No response. The humming grows louder. Cooper advances on the figure.
Caroline?

COOPER 

The humming stops. The figure tenses but doesn't turn. Cooper moves closer.
COOPER 
Caroline, it's me ... it's Dale.
Cooper is right behind the figure. He slowly reaches a hand out, touches the figure tentatively
on the shoulder. We hear a low GROWLING and then the figure turns. It's Annie. As
Caroline.
ANNIE
Dale, oh my God, you startled me. I thought it might be
Windom.
(she embraces him)
Thank God you're here, I've missed you so much.
COOPER
(genuinely)
I've missed you too.
ANNIE
I've been so frightened. I had the most terrible dream.
What was it?

COOPER

ANNIE
I saw the face of the man. The face of the man who killed
me.
Cooper draws back.
ANNIE 
I know who it is. It's the same man who kidnapped me,
the man who gave me the drug. It was Windom, Dale. It
was him all along.
Cooper stares at her.
ANNIE 
What's the matter? Don't you believe me? It's my





 (2)



ANNIE 
husband. He's the killer. He's the one I saw. We've got
to stop him.
COOPER
You said the face of the man who killed you.
ANNIE
Did I? You must be mistaken. I'm alive.

Pause. Cooper seems close to tears.
... Annie?

COOPER

ANNIE
Who's Annie?
Cooper looks around. Speaks to the unseen Earle.
COOPER
Leave her alone. Tell me what you want, just leave her
alone.
 A spotlight comes up on Earle, in top hat and tails. Big band music. Earle sings.
EARLE
"Long ago a glimpse of stocking was looked on as
something, now Heaven knows, anything goes."
The light blacks out. Cooper turns back the other way and sees ...
 A SHADOWY FIGURE ...
...lurking behind Annie, in a slouch hat, holding a long, thin gleaming medical instrument.
Windom...

COOPER

Windom looks up from under the hat and winks at him, then directs Cooper's attention to
another part of the room where ...
 A distraught Earle ...
... sits with two POLICE OFFICERS, describing a crime scene.
EARLE
I came in the door. There was blood on the kitchen





 



EARLE 
floor. I followed it into the living room ... that's where
they were lying ...

Cooper looks over and sees ... Annie, pale and quite obviously dead, lying in the arms of
Cooper's "double" ...
EARLE 
I thought they were both dead. I knew that because I
stabbed them myself.
Earle reveals the medical instrument. Blood on its tip. The double opens its black, lifeless
eyes and stares at Cooper.
COOPER
Don't do this. Don't hurt her. Tell me what you want!
CUT TO:

 THE BLACK CORRIDOR
Cooper and Earle are standing side by side.
EARLE
(casual as an old school chum)
That's more like it. Sorry to put you through that, old
boy, but I did need to secure your cooperation. Don't
worry about your girlfriend. She's alive, of course COOPER
What do you want?
EARLE
Actually, I need you to volunteer for something. A
mission for a man of singular quality Tell me.

COOPER

EARLE
(friendly and jovial)
Come along with me.
He opens a door. Gestures for Cooper to precede him. Cooper does. Earle follows.
 NT. THRONE ROOM

CUT TO:

A black and white doctor's office. Plain. Non-threatening. Two steps lead up to a dentist's
chair on a elevated rostrum.



 
EARLE
Some people, I won't name names, they call the place
Hell. I don't have to tell you what they call the other
place. Needless to say, they've got it all backwards.
This is the place of power. The other's a revolting
mixture of milk-curdling sentimentality and bland
acquiescence to the cosmic equivalent of good table
manners. See, there's Annie.
He points casually to a medical supply cabinet, where Annie is trapped, alive, behind glass.
EARLE 
In case of emergency, break glass.
(turning back to Cooper)
Here's the deal, Dale. Throne room. Windom.
Windom sits on throne. Windom king. Windom happy.
Problem: Windom need to make deposit first. That's
how it works. Windom can't make deposit all by
himself. Windom un-happy.
COOPER
What kind of deposit?
EARLE
Here's where the designers show their ingenuity. In return
for the best seat in the house they want something in
return. Guess what: voluntarily offered, no strings
attached, by its owner and operator ... the soul of a good
human being. Naturally something I have in very short
supply.
(close to him)
That's where you come in.
COOPER
You'll let her go. You'll let her live.
EARLE
(smiles)
Why, Dale, it's as if you read my mind.
COOPER
All right, let's do it. Now. Fast.
EARLE
Lovely. Stand over there.
A light illuminates a single square of the black and white checkerboard floor. Cooper moves









 (2)
to it. Another light illuminates the dentist chair. A third hits Annie. Everything else goes
BLACK. Earle moves to the dentist chair, sits and sing happily.
EARLE 
"Back in the saddle again, out where an Indian's your
friend, where everything is green and you can pee right
into the stream ... back in the saddle again."
A rumbling SOUND. Something approaching. Earle sits back and claps his hands like an
excited child. A DOOR OPENS. A MAN in a version of a white dentist's smock enters,
pushing a covered tray. We can't see his face. He stops next to the chair.
Oh goody.

EARLE 

Suddenly clamps spring out of the arms and legs of the chair. Another slithers around
Windom's neck while yet another gags him.
The Dentist uncovers the table, revealing an array of loathsome medical instruments. The
Dentist picks up a particularly nasty one, a huge syringe, and turns to face them ... it's killer
BOB. Earle squirms, screams. We hear Bob's voice, but his lips don't move.
BOB'S VOICE
(to Cooper, moving towards him)
If you know what's good for you, and you do, don't
move.
(Cooper doesn't)
The fool broke the rules: it's really no good if you don't
volunteer. Doesn't count if you're coerced. He'll have to
be punished and he will be ...
(close to him)
Of course that doesn't mean we have to let you go. This
is for extracting.
Bob grins and is about to use the syringe on Cooper when a HAND reaches in and stops him.
They both turn to look and see ... Laura. Alarm on. Bob's face. A SOUND of two
tremendous energies colliding. A WHITE LIGHT fills the room. Cooper looks to Annie,
who's calling for him silently.
FADE TO WHITE:
FADE IN:
 EXT. WOODS - DAY
Fighting off fatigue, Truman moves around, stretching. Looking back to the grove he sees
someone lying in its center. Truman runs to them. It's Cooper and Annie, both unconscious.






 
TRUMAN
Cooper? Cooper!
(into his walkie-talkie)
Andy, get that ambulance up here right now - Cooper?
He realizes there's blood on Annie's blouse. Cooper opens his eyes.
TRUMAN 
Coop, you okay? Coop? You okay?
Cooper slowly shakes his head and closes his eyes again. SOUND of a siren in the distance.
 INT. GREAT NORTHERN COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO:

Wearing pajamas, Cooper lies in bed. Doc Hayward and Truman attend him. Cooper opens

You've had quite a shock. Everything checks out, though.
You're going to be fine.
TRUMAN
I can't tell you how worried we were. I saw you

Cooper walks slowly to the bathroom and closes the door.
CUT TO:

 INT. COOPER'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Cooper looks at the sink, at his personal effects, he picks up the toothbrush, squeezes some
toothpaste on it and lifts it to his mouth. He holds it in front of his mouth, looks into the
mirror and smiles brightly. Looking into the mirror, staring back at him, is the face of Bob.
