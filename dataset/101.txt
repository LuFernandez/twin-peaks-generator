ACT ONE
FADE IN:
EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
Dawn breaks over the Great Northern.
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
We hear him before we see him, but DALE COOPER is perched six
inches above the floor in a one-handed yoga "frog" position,
wearing boxer shorts and a pair of socks, talking into the
tape recorder which is sitting on the carpet near his head.
COOPER
Diane... 6:18 a.m., room 315, Great
Northern Hotel up here in Twin
Peaks. Slept pretty well. Nonsmoking room. No tobacco smell.
That's a nice consideration for the
business traveler. A hint of
douglas fir needles in the air. As
Sheriff Truman indicated they
would, everything this hotel
promised, they've delivered: clean,
reasonably priced accommodations...
telephone works... bathroom in
really tip-top shape... no drips,
plenty of hot water with good,
steady pressure... could be a sidebenefit of the waterfall just
outside my window... firm mattress,
but not too firm... and no lumps
like that time I told you about
down in El Paso... Diane, what a
nightmare that was, but of course
you've heard me tell that story
once or twice before. Haven't tried
the television. Looks like cable,
probably no reception problems. But
the true test of any hotel, as you
know, is that morning cup of
coffee, which I'll be getting back
to you about within the half
hour... Diane, it struck me again
earlier this morning;

2.
COOPER (CONT'D)
there are two things that continue
to trouble me, and I'm not just
speaking as an agent of the Bureau,
but also as a human being: what
really went on between Marilyn
Monroe and the Kennedys? And who
really pulled the trigger on JFK?

CUT TO:
EXT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S HOUSE - MORNING
A rustic log house, with the Sheriff's cruiser parked in
front. A rooster crows. SHERIFF TRUMAN exits the house,
carrying a soiled paper bag. He walks around the side yard to
a chicken coop and scatters the feed he has in the bag into
the coop. They start clucking and pecking.
TRUMAN
How you girls doing this morning?
Sounds like you got plenty to talk
about today. Hope it's good news.
He empties the bag and starts towards the cruiser.
CUT TO:
EXT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DAY
A sign reads: WAGON-WHEEL DO-NUTS
CUT TO:
INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - MORNING
A banner reads: GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DONUT. Another banner
reads:
SQUARE DEALS ON ROUND DONUTS.
DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN and LUCY MORAN are at the counter, in the
middle of ordering.
LUCY
...two boxes of chocolate creams
with jimmies, a box of maple
bearclaws, one raspberry swizzle
twist, two boxes of jelly donuts...
(to Andy)
I'm ordering extra jelly donuts
because they're Agent Cooper's
favorite, you know my aunt I told
you about with the raccoons?
(MORE)


3.
LUCY (CONT'D)
She liked jelly donuts, they were
her favorite, but she doesn't
remind me at all of Agent Cooper.
(a new thought)
Her son, though, does--

ANDY
And one plum frappe turnover.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S CRUISER - MORNING
Truman drives past the Wagon-Wheel Do-Nuts just in time to
see Lucy and Andy leaving the shop, with Andy carrying a
stack of donut boxes up to his neck. Truman pulls into the
parking lot next to them and leans out the window.
TRUMAN
Can I give you three a lift?
LUCY
(looking around)
But Sheriff, there's only two of
us. Truman and Andy look at each
other.
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL DINING ROOM - DAY
Dale Cooper sits at a choice corner table, holding a fresh,
hot cup of coffee, as a WAITRESS comes by, holding the coffee
pot.
COOPER
(holding up a hand to stop
her)
Wait right there, wait right
there...
(he sniffs the coffee;
hmm... he sips)
You know, this is, excuse me, a
damn good cup of coffee. I've had I
can't tell you many cups of coffee
I've had in my life and this...
(another sip)
...this is one of the best.
Thank you.

WAITRESS


4.

COOPER
I'd like two eggs, over hard, don't
tell me, I know it's hard on the
arteries, but old habits die hard,
just about as hard as I want those
eggs... bacon, super-crispy, almost
burned: cremate it-CUT TO:
AUDREY HORNE
Across the room, watching Cooper order. She slips into her
beguiling, rip-your-heart-out routine and sashays across the
dining room to Cooper's table.
COOPER
(just finishing up)
...that's great, I'll have the
grapefruit juice, as long as...
(sees Audrey approaching)
...those grapefruits are freshly
squeezed.
The Waitress departs. Audrey smiles.
AUDREY
My name is Audrey Horne.
COOPER
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
AUDREY
Can I sit here?
COOPER
(pleasantly)
Miss Horne, unless I miss my guess,
your father is Benjamin Horne, the
owner of this fine establishment,
so I guess you can sit anywhere you
like. And I'd also like to add that
it would be my pleasure.
Audrey sits, a little confused, runs a hand over her
forehead.
AUDREY
You know, sometimes I get so
flushed... it's interesting.


5.

COOPER
Were you a friend of Laura
Palmer's?
AUDREY
Not exactly.
COOPER
Her father works for your father.
Did you know each other growing up?
AUDREY
Oh, we knew each other...
COOPER
But there was something about her
you didn't like.
AUDREY
Everybody liked Laura. She was just
Little Miss Perfect. Laura tutored
my older brother Johnny three times
a week. Johnny's twenty-seven and
he's in the third grade. He's got
emotional problems; it runs in the
family. Do you like my ring?
(hold out her hand to show
a big rock)
Very nice.

COOPER

AUDREY
My father bought it for me. My
father was crazy about Laura. He
bought her a pony when she was
nine, but he let her father say it
was from him. Its name was Troy.
(absent-mindedly rubs her
left palm)
Do your palms ever itch? Cooper
studies her benignly.
CUT TO:
BENJAMIN HORNE
Crossing the hallway outside the dining room, he glances in
and sees his daughter sitting with Dale Cooper. He stops,
takes this in, then moves on.
CUT TO:


6.

EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - MORNING
The trucker, LEO JOHNSON, is obsessively cleaning the cab of
his semi rig with a dustbuster. A bucket of hot water, some
sponges, and a hose are at the ready nearby. We see that
Leo's name is stenciled on the rig's door, along with the
name, "BIG PUSSYCAT." SHELLY JOHNSON, in her waitress
uniform, comes up to the truck.
SHELLY
Leo, honey? I gotta go to work now,
Norma'll be here any sec... Leo?
Leo turns off the dustbuster and turns to her.
LEO
Did you finish cleaning my boots?
SHELLY
They're all done, and I did the
laundry, too.
All of it?

LEO

SHELLY
Well, yeah.
LEO
No you didn't.
He grabs a used grocery bag full of dirty clothes from the
cab and flings it at her.
SHELLY
Sure, Leo, when I get home I'll-LEO
Now, Shelly.
Okay.

SHELLY

Shelly starts back towards the house.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - MORNING
Shelly dumps the clothes out of the grocery bag onto a
laundry basket in front of the washer. She shakes out the
clothes before putting them in.


7.

She stops short when she sees a large, dark red bloodstain on
a faded blue cowboy work shirt. She starts to tremble. She
hears a car horn beep outside. She looks out the window, sees
Norma's car pull in near the truck but she doesn't see Leo.
She hears the screen door open and bang shut in the other
room.
LEO'S VOICE
Shelly? Norma's here.
Shelly makes a brave decision: quickly folds the bloodstained
shirt and stashes it behind the washer, dumps the rest of the
clothes in the washer, closes the door and starts it just as
Leo comes in the room.
LEO
Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's
here?
SHELLY
I heard you, Leo.
She starts out. He catches her by the arm.
LEO
I'm gonna come by the diner
sometime today. Be a good girl and
save me a piece 'a pie.
He pinches her cheek softly and holds it.
SHELLY
(manages a smile)
Sure, Leo.
He works her cheek for a moment, squeezing a bit harder.
Shelly hides her fear.
CUT TO:
EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE/INT. NORMA'S CAR
NORMA sits behind the wheel of a maroon '64 Falcon station
wagon. Shelly gets in beside her and they drive off.
NORMA
Leo sure does keep that truck up,
doesn't he?
SHELLY
He sure does.


8.

NORMA
(glances at her, sees her
condition)
We're sure a couple 'a characters,
aren't we, Shelly?
SHELLY
Norma, you said a mouthful and then
some.
NORMA
(shakes her head)
Guys...
SHELLY
(shakes her head)
Guys.
NORMA
You hear what happened at the
Roadhouse last night?
No.

SHELLY

NORMA
Big fight. Bobby Briggs hit Ed
Hurley with some brass knuckles-SHELLY
Bobby hit Ed? Weird.
They look at each other, each knowing the other's secret, but
not saying so.
NORMA
Ed's got a concussion. Then Bobby
and Mike got into it with the
Bookhouse Boys, took two patrol
cars to break it up. Bobby and
Mike're probably still in jail.
SHELLY
(shakes her head)
Guys...
Guys.

NORMA

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ENTRANCE - MORNING
Re-establish.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - MORNING
Deputy Andy takes a big bite of his plum frappe turnover,
just as Dale Cooper breezes through the front door and waves
brightly as he passes.
COOPER
Morning, deputy.
ANDY
(his mouth completely
full)
Good morning, Agent Cooper.
Lucy, at the coffee station holding a pot and a cup, turns to
face Cooper, with a doughnut stuck in her mouth.
COOPER
Hey there, Lucy.
LUCY
(barely intelligible)
Agent Cooper, I got jelly for you
special, the Sheriff's down the
hall in Interrogation.
COOPER
I'll just look for him down in
Interrogation.
He moves down the hall.
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - MORNING
Cooper whisks in just as Truman, coffee mug in hand, takes an
enormous bite of a humongous bearclaw.
COOPER
Hey, Sheriff: three for three.
Truman tries to chew, but holds up his hand to be patient.
Cooper sits.


10.

COOPER (CONT'D)
Number one, James Hurley: as soon
as his lawyer gets here, we bring
him up from Cell Four and talk to
him straight. He was in love with
Laura Palmer, my bet is she told
him whatever dirt she knew about
Bobby and Mike and who knows what
else... if James plays ball, we
send him off with our blessings and
a firm reminder to watch his back
when Mike and Bobby hit the
streets...
(Truman nods, trying to
chew fast)
Then we'll have a chat with those
two perpetrators, let's run a top
to bottom on Bobby's vehicle and in
the meantime, let's find out what
the autopsy report on Laura Palmer
gives us.
(he rises)
I've got the rest of the day mapped
out. I'll meet you back here in
Interrogation... I really have to
urinate. By the way, the coffee at
the Great Northern? Incredible.
He exits, just as Truman finally swallows his mouthful of
bearclaw.
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY
JAMES HURLEY is seated, next to his LAWYER, across from
Truman, as Cooper enters and sits down beside the Sheriff.
TRUMAN
James has been advised of his
rights.
COOPER
James, you were placed under arrest
for suspicion of murder, the murder
of Laura Palmer. You have no
previous criminal record, is that
correct?
JAMES
None. No, sir.


11.

Cooper turns on the VCR and we see the same videotape of
Laura and Donna at the picnic that we saw earlier. James
watches the video.
COOPER
James, did you shoot this
videotape?
Cooper fast forwards to the freeze frame of the motorcycle
reflected in Laura's eye.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Isn't that your cycle, James?
JAMES
Yes, sir, it is. The three of us
went up there three Sundays ago.
COOPER
(gently)
James, you were in love with Laura.
(James is silent)
The two of you were seeing each
other secretly. No one else at the
school, or any of her friends knew
about it; she was the homecoming
queen, her boyfriend was the
captain of the football team. How
much longer did you think you could
keep this relationship secret?
JAMES
It was secret because that's the
way she wanted it.
COOPER
Why do you suppose that was, James?
Do think it had something to do
with Bobby?
JAMES
It had everything to do with Bobby.
COOPER
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?
JAMES
I think so.
COOPER
Did you know that Laura was using
cocaine?


12.

Yes.

JAMES
(pause)

COOPER
Did you ever take cocaine with her?
JAMES
No, I tried to get her to stop.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw her?
JAMES
Two nights ago. The night she died.
For about three hours. She snuck
out of the house about 9:30. About
12:30 I stopped the bike at the
light at Sparkwood and 21. She
jumped off and ran away. I didn't
see her again.
COOPER
You're sure it was 12:30?
JAMES
Yes, sir, Steve's Liquor Locker was
closing up as we drove by and he
closes right at 12:30.
COOPER
You and Laura have a fight?
JAMES
Not exactly. But she said she
couldn't see me anymore.
Why?

COOPER

JAMES
She didn't say.
COOPER
Was she high that night?
Yes.

JAMES

COOPER
Where did she get her drugs?


13.

JAMES
I don't know. Most of the time we
were together she was clean.
COOPER
Did she get her drugs from Bobby?
JAMES
I really don't know where she got
'em, she never talked about it. She
didn't like that part of herself.
COOPER
Why did she start using again?
JAMES
(getting emotional)
I don't know. Something happened, a
couple of days ago-COOPER
What happened?
JAMES
I don't know exactly. I think
something scared her. She wouldn't
talk to me, she wouldn't see me for
a couple days-COOPER
Until the last night.
Yes.

JAMES

COOPER
Did she call you that night?
Yes.

JAMES

Cooper looks at Laura's diary, opened in front of him, at the
page for February 5th; the page marked "DAY ONE." He takes
the half-hearted necklace from his pocket.
COOPER
Did you recognize this necklace,
James?
Yes, sir.

JAMES


14.

COOPER
James, what happened on February
Tears form in his eyes. He fights them back.
WHITE OUT TO:
EXT. PARK - DAY
LAURA PALMER, lying on a picnic blanket, playfully turns to
face James.
LAURA
What day is it today?
Sunday.

JAMES

LAURA
No, I mean the date.
JAMES
The fifth of February.
LAURA
Okay. It's an important day for me,
James. You've got three guesses why
I'm so happy today.
JAMES
Because you're the most beautiful
girl in the world?
No.

LAURA

JAMES
Because you have the cutest nose in
the world?
No.

LAURA

JAMES
Because your skin is soft and you
smell so good?
No.
Why?

LAURA
JAMES


15.

LAURA
Because I really believe that you
love me.
She takes the necklace from her pocket, "breaks" the heart in
two, gives half to James and puts the other half around her
neck.
WHITE OUT TO:
JAMES Sitting in interrogation.

Looks up at Cooper.

JAMES
I don't remember.
Cooper looks at him.

Damn it.

LEO

He jumps down from the cab and runs towards the house.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHNSON LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
Leo hurries in, throws open the top of the washer, pulls out
the full load of soggy laundry and searches through them,
looking for the bloody shirt that he does not find.
NO!

LEO

Leo kicks the washer hard. The washer goes "tilt" and makes a
loud, rhythmic honking sound.
FADE OUT:
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
FADE IN:
INT. DONNA HAYWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD lies asleep in bed. The sound of an operatic
aria drifts through the room, originating downstairs. Donna
shifts, starting to waken, stretches and smiles like an
untroubled angel. Then her eyes open and she remembers
Laura's death.
CUT TO:
INT. HAYWARD LIVING ROOM - DAY
Donna enters the room, where her mother, EILEEN, sits in her
wheelchair doing elaborate needlepoint, listening to the
opera on the hi-fi.
Mom?
Mom?

DONNA
(Eileen doesn't hear her)

EILEEN
Oh, good morning, dear, I didn't
hear you come down.
She uses a remote control to turn down the volume of the hifi and takes her daughter's hand.
DONNA
Mom, it's ten-thirty, why didn't
you wake me? I was supposed to go
down to the sherrif's-EILEEN
They called this morning and said
they could wait until tomorrow to
see you. Your father and I thought
you should rest. You woke us crying
in your sleep last night, do you
remember?
DONNA
No, really?
EILEEN
We feel so badly for you, we're so
sorry.


17.

DONNA
(sits beside her)
Mom, it's so strange. I know I
should be sad, and I am, part of me
is, but I... it's like I'm having
the most beautiful dream and the
most terrible nightmare all at
once.
EILEEN
Your father told me you went out
last night to meet a boy named
James Hurley. Does this have
anything to do with him?
DONNA
(nods, decides to confide)
Can this be between you and me?
EILEEN
(takes her hand)
Of course it can.
DONNA
James and Laura were seeing each
other the last two months. They
fell in love. I was the only one
who knew about it. James was so
good for her, you don't know how
troubled Laura was, the kind of
trouble she was in and how much she
wanted to get away from Bobby-EILEEN
I've been waiting for something
like this about Bobby. And what
about Mike?
DONNA
Mom, Laura and I made a pact. We
wanted to get away from them, from
both of them-EILEEN
Are you saying you think Bobby had
something to do with Laura's death?
DONNA
I don't know. I think Bobby's
dangerous, I think he's capable of
almost anything.


18.

EILEEN
What did you tell the police?
DONNA
Nothing, I don't have any proof of
anything and what's terrible is
James was with Laura the night she
died, but Mom, I know he didn't do
it. Last night, I had to see him,
we were the two closest people to
her in the world. But I feel so
bad...
EILEEN
Why, angel?
DONNA
Because we realized that all this
time... we were the ones who were
falling in love. I feel like I've
betrayed my best friend...
(tears)
...but if that's true, then why do
I feel so happy?
Donna falls into her mother's arms.
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
LELAND PALMER sits behind his desk, talking on the telephone.
His SECRETARY sits across from him.
LELAND
...Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R... yes,
that's correct, my daughter... her
name was Laura... I'm calling to
make the arrangements, the funeral,
everything, I want everything taken
care of, I don't care how much it
costs, and if you don't mind, I'd
prefer that we not discuss money...
During above, Benjamin Horne enters, stops and listens.
LELAND
...I don't understand the
question... what's the difference?
What do you mean "leak"... seepage?
I think I-(loses it; almost a moan)
(MORE)


19.
LELAND (CONT'D)
--no, don't-(screams)

DON'T TELL ME!!! DON'T TELL ME!!!
He pushes the phone and everything else on his desk away from
him. He gets up, crosses to a cabinet stereo, turns on the
sound on a modern jazz quartet record, 9/4 time, about as
loud as it can go. Benjamin goes to the Secretary.
BENJAMIN
(quietly)
Take him to the lounge and call Dr.
Jacoby.
She nods, goes to Leland, takes him gently by the arm and
leads him out of the room. Benjamin Horne turns down the
sound on the stereo, goes to the desk and picks up the phone.
BENJAMIN
This is Benjamin Horne, who am I
speaking to?... fine... mahogany
and teak? Well, you can forget
that, Mr. Formaldehyde, I'm picking
up the tab here and you vampires
are not taking a bite out of my
checkbook in order to exploit my
colleague's tragedy... start
thinking lead.
He slams down the phone, just as we hear, from outside...
JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
No, no, no, don't put 'em in my
room, in here, through that door
right there!
JERRY HORNE, Benjamin's younger, wiry brother enters,
followed by four BELLHOPS, carrying a mess of mismatched
samsonite.
BENJAMIN
Good to have you back, Jerry, how
was Paris?
JERRY
(shakes his head)
In a minute...
(turns back to the
Bellhops, points down)
Right THERE, no, no, right THERE!
The Bellhops carefully set the bags down as directed.


20.

JERRY
What's the matter with Leland?
Looks like somebody shot his dog.
The Bellhops all stop and look at Benjamin.
JERRY
What is WITH you guys? I've got a
sandwich in there and I want all
those bags opened--we're looking
till we find it.
The Bellhops hop to it; all the bags are opened. Jerry tosses
clothes around the room until he finds a baguette with brie
wrapped in white paper.
JERRY
Brother Ben, this is the best damn
sandwich I ever ate, it's a
baguette, with brie and butter, had
four of these damn things every day
I was there.
(he reaches in and finds
another one)
Got a couple left--here, try one.
BENJAMIN
(takes the sandwich)
Jerry, Leland's daughter was
murdered. And the Norweigans left.
JERRY
Did they sign?
BENJAMIN
No. The deal's off.
JERRY
We had those Vikings by the horns,
what happened?
BENJAMIN
One of 'em left a note.
JERRY
What's it say?
BENJAMIN
We're not a hundred percent sure,
they took the translator with 'em.


21.

JERRY
Did you say Leland's daughter was
murdered?... Laura?
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION INTERROGATION - DAY
DR. HAYWARD opens the folder containing Laura's autopsy
report, ready to share the results to Truman and Cooper. Dr.
Hayward absentmindedly tugs on a thread sticking out of his
sleeve.
HAYWARD
Harry, as you know, I delivered
Laura. I knew her her entire life;
she was my daughter's best friend.
I couldn't bring myself to do the
postmortem, so last night I called
in Joe Fielding from Fairvale. He
did the work, I assisted, this is
what he found...
(puts on glasses, consults
sheet)
Time of death estimated to be
between midnight and four a.m. What
killed her was loss of blood.
Numerous shallow wounds, no single
one serious enough to have been the
cause of death. Bite marks. On her
tongue, probably self-inflicted.
Lesions on wrists, ankles, and
upper arms, where she was bound.
We're waiting on toxological tests
for drug use. Within the last
twelve hours of her life, she had
sexual relations with at least
three men.
He tugs again on the loose thread of his sleeve; a button
pops off his shirt, hits the table and spins. He takes off
his glasses, wipes his eyes.
COOPER
And you've examined Ronette Pulaski
as well?
HAYWARD
(composing himself)
Yes. Wound patterns are consistent.
In my mind, there's no question the
same perpetrator attacked them
both.


22.

TRUMAN
Doc, when, if ever, will Ronette be
able to talk to us?
HAYWARD
She suffered a severe head wound,
it's still too early to tell, add
to that the psychological impact of
the fear, probably witnessing what
happened to Laura before her...
COOPER
The answer's in there somewhere.
Doc Hayward looks at a close-up picture of Laura taken where
she was found on the beach.
HAYWARD
So beautiful. Who would do a thing
like that?
CUT TO:
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY
Mike and Bobby sit on their steel cots. Mike moves to Bobby,
who's hanging his head upside down off the back of the cot,
kneels down beside him and speaks to him quietly.
MIKE
Hey Bopper... since when does Leo
Johnson call me at my parent's
house?
BOBBY
Leo called you?
MIKE
Yesterday. He was looking for you.
He wanted to know where the other
half of the money was.
BOBBY
What'd you tell him, Snake?
MIKE
Hey, as far as I knew, he didn't
have any of it yet. I thought the
deal was we were supposed to give
it to him today.
BOBBY
I gave him half already.


23.

MIKE
(surprised and a little
angry)
When did you see him?
BOBBY
Hey, I saw him the other night,
okay?
MIKE
What night? You mean Thursday
night?
BOBBY
Yeah, Thursday.
MIKE
Wait a minute, the night we
followed Laura back to her place
after she left your house-BOBBY
Check. We had a couple brewskis and
I dropped you off.
Check.

MIKE

BOBBY
(lowering his voice
further)
And then I went to see Leo, cause I
had this money burning a ten
thousand dollar hole in my pocket.
MIKE
What about the other half?
BOBBY
It's in Laura's safe deposit box.
MIKE
You didn't get it back from her?
BOBBY
She was supposed to hand it over
today. Then she went and checked
out on us.
MIKE
So how we gonna get that ten grand
for Leo?


24.

BOBBY
(wise-ass)
I don't know, Snake. Maybe we could
sell light bulbs door-to-door.
MIKE
That's great, that's just great.
This isn't funny, man.
BOBBY
You see me laughing?
MIKE
We're lucky we're in jail, you know
what's gonna go down when we get
out? Maybe we ought'a figure a way
to stay in here-BOBBY
(grabs his shirt)
Don't even think like that--and
don't mention one word about Leo
Johnson, you do not know Leo
Johnson.
MIKE
But what about-The holding area door opens. Hawk leads James back in and
takes him back to his cell. Bobby jumps up from his cot and
moves to the bars.
BOBBY
Oh, look at that. Here comes that
accident waiting to happen.
HAWK
That could constitute a threat,
Briggs.
BOBBY
Gee, I'm sorry.
James enters his cell.
CUT TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Truman and Cooper make their way towards the front, as ED
HURLEY, a bandage on his head, rises from his seat.


25.

TRUMAN
Hey Ed, how's that coconut?
ED
Kind'a tender. My pride's hurt
worse.
TRUMAN
Yeah, since when can some 18 yearold punk take Big Ed Hurley out,
even if he was wearing knuckle
dusters. Ed, this is Agent Dale
Cooper.
COOPER
(shakes hands)
Any relation to James?
ED
I'm his uncle. His mother's out of
town, called this morning, asked me
to come on over. You fellas plan on
holding him a while?
COOPER
No, we can release him into your
custody.
Truman looks at him.
ED
Let me understand; is James being
charged?
COOPER
I had one small doubt which James
has satisfactorily cleared up for
me. He didn't kill anybody. But you
tell him to be careful; we're going
to have to release Mike and Bobby
today as well.
Will do.

ED

Lucy calls from the switchboard.


26.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, I've got a call for
you from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield,
sounds like long distance, it has
that open-air sound where it sounds
like the wind blowing, you know,
like wind through the trees-Cooper moves towards her to take the call. Ed takes Truman by
the arm and lowers his voice.
ED
Harry, I've been thinking about
last night at the Roadhouse:
something's not right.
TRUMAN
(kidding him)
Yeah, when I first saw the bandage
I thought Nadine might've gotten
wind of you and Norma.
ED
Harry, if Nadine'd gotten wind of
me and Norma, I'd be playing harp
for the Heavenly All-Stars. No, the
thing is I can remember Mike and
Bobby grabbing Donna, I stood up to
walk over and I got all
lightheaded, I was out on my feet
before I got there, I don't even
remember getting hit-TRUMAN
What are you saying?
ED
I'm pretty sure my beer was
drugged. And you know who was
tending bar last night.
Truman thinks a moment, then nods.
CUT TO:
COOPER
On the phone at the switchboard.
COOPER
Alright, Albert, bring the boys,
you guys can have the body all day
tomorrow... no, can't do it,
they're gonna bury her on Monday...

EXT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
Carrying a small tray of sandwiches, Norma is going into the
hardware store down the block from the Double R Diner. She
holds the door open for a woman who's exiting, obscured
behind a big bag of hardware. It's NADINE HURLEY. Norma sees
her first.
NORMA
(pleasantly)
Hi, Nadine.
NADINE
What are you doing here, Norma?
NORMA
(pleasantly)
I might ask you the same question.
NADINE
(a hint of aggressiveness)
And I will tell you: I've gotten
all new drapes for my house. Ed
bought them for me yesterday at
Gentle Jim's and we installed them
together.They're a beige sheer. I
was up all night, do you know what
I was doing?
NORMA
(a little worried)
No, I don't.
NADINE
I was inventing a noiseless,
completely silent drape runner. And
do you know how it works, do you
know what makes it work? The thing
I thought of at four this morning
while I was waiting for my husband
to be released from intensive care?
NORMA
What's that?


28.

Nadine takes a package out of the bag, wrenches it open and
grabs a handfull of...
NADINE
Cotton balls. By God, those
things'll be quiet now.
Nadine moves off. Norma enters the store.

Mom still out of town?
ED
Yeah. She's still out of town.

Mike sits at the table, as Dale Cooper enters.
COOPER
So tell me, Mike, what are you
doing hanging around with a guy
like Bobby Briggs?


29.

MIKE
He's my friend.
COOPER
You don't seem like such a bad kid
to me, but Bobby Briggs could drag
you straight into hell. How long
has Donna Hayward been your
girlfriend?
MIKE
Around two years.
COOPER
Why were you screaming at her and
roughing her up last night at the
Roadhouse?
MIKE
That's between her and me.
COOPER
Between you and her, or you, her,
and James Hurley?
MIKE
What's that supposed to mean?
COOPER
You guys were out looking for James
last night-MIKE
That's right, he was fooling around
with Laura, next thing we know
she's dead and he's out fooling
around with Donna-COOPER
You couldn't find James so you
picked a fight with his gang
instead.
MIKE
They started it.
COOPER
After Bobby decked Ed Hurley with a
pair of brass knuckles?


30.

MIKE
He was defending himself--look, I
already spent a night in jail, are
you charging me with something?
COOPER
Settle down there, punk. I could
make one phone call and you'd go so
far away God couldn't find you.
Cooper smiles.

Mike gets the picture.

Truman sits across from Bobby, filling out a report, when
Cooper breezily enters.
COOPER
Hi, Bobby, I was just talking to
Mike. Now before we get started,
have you got your stories straight?
BOBBY
If you tell the truth, you don't
have to get your stories straight.
Besides, the sheriff tells me we're
just in here for fighting and it
was self-defense.
COOPER
Right. Well, I guess you can go
then.
Cooper sits, takes the whistle he whittled out of his pocket
and begins to sand it with a small piece of folded sandpaper.
Truman looks at him.
...now?
Yeah.

JOSIE
On top of the morning to you, Pete.
PETE
No, Josie, the expression is "top

...and it's just barely morning.
JOSIE

So perhaps I should say, "Bottom of

PETE
That'd be more like it.

Josie enters with Pete.

Cooper and Truman rise.

TRUMAN
Mrs. Packard, this is Dale Cooper,
FBI.
COOPER
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
JOSIE
Thank you. Can I offer you
gentlemen a cup of joe?
COOPER
Mrs. Packard, you said the magic
word.
TRUMAN
I'd love a cup, thanks.
PETE
I'll get that for you. Mr. Cooper,
how do you take it?
COOPER
Black as midnight on a moonless
night.
PETE
Pretty black.

JOSIE
Please, grab yourself a chair.
They all sit. Out of sight, the little dog barks again.

COOPER
Look at him, what a cute little
fellow, what's his name?
Koro.

JOSIE

COOPER
(filing this away)
Koro. Koro. That means something.
JOSIE
Chinese. I am not sure exactly. My
late husband Andrew named him.
"Big, steaming engine" perhaps?
Cooper starts to bend down to pet Koro, Truman tries to
signal him not to. A growl, a yip and Cooper withdraws his
hand.
COOPER
Mrs. Packard, I'll come right to
the point. Mrs. Packard, I
understand that you'd hired Laura
to come see you twice a week to
help you with your English, is that
correct?
JOSIE
Yes, you see my late husband,
Andrew... I first learned English
from him, when we met in Hong Kong,
but I have learned after his death
that he spoke only in what you
would call "western cliches"-COOPER
That's very interesting, Mrs.
Packard, so you hired Laura to help
you-JOSIE
That is the ticket, because I was
apparently not even saying the
cliches correctly.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw
Laura?
JOSIE
Thursday afternoon, about the time
the mill blew five.


35.

COOPER
That would be five o'clock?
Yes.

JOSIE

COOPER
When did she leave?
JOSIE
After one hour, when the lesson was
finished. I did not see her again.
COOPER
How did she seem to you on Thursday
afternoon?
JOSIE
Something was bothering her but we
did not have a heart-to-heart on
it. She said one thing, though,
which stuck to my mind. She said,
"I think now I know how you feel...
about your husband's death."
COOPER
Did she say what that was in
reference to?
JOSIE
No, but I think of it now like an
old song with a haunting melody
that I can't stop hearing in my
head.
COOPER
Uh-huh. Did you ask her then what
she meant by this?
JOSIE
It was just as she was leaving.
There was no time.
She stares at the floor. Cooper and Truman look at each
other. The phone rings.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
Excuse me, please...
She rises and exits. Cooper smiles strangely at Truman.
COOPER
How long have you been seeing her?


36.

TRUMAN
(about three different
reactions before...)
How did you know?
COOPER
Body language.
TRUMAN
Geez... uh, not long. About six
weeks. Andrew died a year and a
half ago.
Pete sticks his head back in.
PETE
You'd never guess; had to make a
new pot: there was a fish in the
percolator.
Pete exits.
COOPER
Was there an inquest into her
husband's death?
TRUMAN
Yeah. He took his 36-footer out on
Black Lake. He'd just put in a
customized, high performance
engine, there was an explosion on
board. We found pieces of the boat
but nothing of Andrew. It was ruled
accidental.
COOPER
(lowers his voice)
You never found the body?
TRUMAN
Don't look to me like that. He was
like a father to me.
COOPER
Take it easy, Harry, you're so far
above suspicion I can't even see
you through the clouds.

shenanigans cost us yesterday, you
do know what shenanigans are, don't
you?...
Josie mouths the word, not at all sure.
CATHERINE (CONT'D)
Shutting down the mill for eight
hours, plus the night-shift, cost
us eighty-seven thousand dollars
and change. Do you really think
that would have made Andrew happy?
She hangs up. Turns and raises her glass and touches glasses

Oh, I'm sorry, did I offend your

My mistake. I'd gotten used to us

BENJAMIN
Sweetheart, it's all the same to
me.
CATHERINE
Well I'm no schoolgirl either.
What's the next step?
BENJAMIN
(sits down beside her on
the bed)
We may not have to do anything: a
few more local tragedies and Josie
may run that mill into the ground
herself.
CATHERINE
You should have seen her, so proud
and weepy over that little
cheerleader's death, as if she was
the only one in the world with
feelings.
BENJAMIN
But the fact is those losses are
going to look beautiful in the
books.
CATHERINE
With the pace we've set, it'll
still be months before that mill's
bankrupt. I don't know if I can
wait that long. Besides, there's
always a chance my knothead husband
may decide to take a peek at those
dusty old books.

Maybe it's time for a fire.

Twenty-seven, going on six.

Just kidding. Sorry.
TRUMAN
And you've been treating him for

JACOBY
Treating him? Well, with Johnny,
it's not so much a question of
treating him-COOPER
I understand Laura Palmer was his
tutor.
JACOBY
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
after school. Those were the same
days I'd come to see Johnny and his
mother. Laura was Johnny's
favorite. He knew which day it was,
too, he'd stand just like that,
waiting for her.
COOPER
Does Johnny get out much?
JACOBY
Sure, after his schoolwork... Laura
would take him out on the grounds
hunting for rubber buffalo with his
little suction-cupped bow and arrow
set. Some afternoons, he'd bag the
limit.
TRUMAN
Was she here on Wednesday
afternoon?

JACOBY
Yes, she was. I sat in with them.
She read him a story.
COOPER
What story was that?
JACOBY

Yes. But of course all that

MAJOR BRIGGS
For what we are about to receive,

Bobby indifferently moves his meatloaf around the plate and
mashes up the chips with a spoon.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Robert, I was hoping we'd have a
chance to discuss the events of the
past few days. Not the physical
events themselves necessarily, but
the thoughts and feelings
surrounding them.
Bobby rolls his eyes. Major Briggs is undeterred.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Rebellion in a young man of your
age is a necessary fact of life,
and, candidly, a sign of strength.
In other words, I respect your
rebellious nature, Bobby. However,
being your father, I am obligated
to contain that fire of
contrariness within the bounds
established by society as well as
those within our family structure.
Bobby impatiently taps his water glass with his knife.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Bobby, I note your reluctance to
engage in a dialogue with me, your
father. There are times when
silence is golden. Silence can be
taken many ways; as a sign of
intelligence... truth being
invisible... and the quieter we
become, the more we can hear...
Bobby shakes out a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. The Major
calmly and firmly backhands Bobby across the face. The
cigarette flies across the table and spears into the meatloaf
on Betty's plate. Bobby's stunned more than hurt.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
I am a tolerant man, but my
patience has its limits.

Ronette is visible in b.g., lying on a bed in intensive care.
A STATE TROOPER stands guard in front of the entrance to the
room. (note: do not show Ronette's face)
HAWK
(summing up)
So neither one of you saw Ronette
after school that day...
MRS. PULASKI
That's right.
HAWK
And as far as you know, she went to
her after school job...
JANEK
Yes. At Horne's Department Store
downtown.
HAWK
What did she do at the department
store?
MRS. PULASKI
She was a salesperson at the
perfume counter.
JANEK
She used to joke it was the bestsmelling job she ever had.
Mrs. Pulaski thinks of her daughter and gets a little tearyeyed. Hawk looks up and sees... ...the ONE-ARMED MAN looking
around the corner in his direction. As soon as the One-Armed
Man sees Hawk and the Trooper, he slowly recedes back around
the corner.
HAWK
Excuse me...


53.

Hawk rises and quietly follows the One-Armed Man around the
corner.
CUT TO:
THE ONE-ARMED MAN
As he ducks into a stairwell and waits. Hawk's footsteps pass
by... The One-Armed Man quietly moves away, down the stairs.
CUT TO:
HAWK Stops in the corridor. Listens. Comes back. He opens the
door to the stairway... empty.

EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
In a long shot, Norma drives up, Shelly hops out and starts
for the house, carrying a bag of groceries.
SHELLY'S VOICE
Thanks, Norma. See you tomorrow.
CUT TO:
INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Shelly enters the house, sets down the keys. Silence.
SHELLY
Leo?... Leo, honey, you here?
She moves towards the kitchen.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHNSON'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
CLOSE on a new bar of soap being dropped into a dark sock.
Leo ties the sock off, swings it around, slaps it into his
palm a couple of times.
LEO
I'll be right out, Shelly.
CUT TO:


54.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Leo comes out of the kitchen, swinging the sock around.
Shelly turns as he enters...
Hi, Leo...

SHELLY

She sees the sock in his hand, turns pale and goes weak in
the knees.
LEO
Where's my shirt?
Shirt?

SHELLY

LEO
(advancing on her)
My favorite blue shirt. That's the
second one you've lost this year...
I'm going to teach you a lesson
now, Shelly, about taking care of
my property; that means not only
keeping things clean but making
sure things aren't damaged or lost-this is gonna hurt you-She pushes the bag of groceries at him and throws herself
onto the couch, protecting her face, terrified. The groceries
fall to the floor, something breaks and spills. Leo walks
over to the stereo and turns it on; loud, heavy metal. Leo
starts to spin over his sock, gaining momentum... and as it
flies out of frame, we...

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Audrey Horne is walking down a corridor when a gust of wind
slams a heavy door shut behind her. She jumps, then regains
her composure.
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Audrey moves down the corridor. SOUND of the wind continues
to howl. When she hears a voice she slows, sneaks around the
next corner and peeks through partially open door into...
INTERCUT:


55.

AUDREY'S POV - BENJAMIN HORNE'S OFFICE
Benjamin Horne is pouring a couple of stiff Scotches on the
rocks. He hands one to his brother Jerry, who's walking back
and forth, rubbing his hands gleefully together.
JERRY
Ben-jamin, Ben-jamin, Ben-jamin-BENJAMIN
What the hell are you so happy
about?
JERRY
I'll give you a One-Eyed guess
where I'm going tonight.
BENJAMIN
Can you get your mind out of the
gutter for one second? We've got a
tottering empire on our hands-JERRY
Come on, Brother Ben, I hear they
dropped a new bombshell up at
"Jack's"-- straight from the
perfume counter, am I right? Am I
right?
BENJAMIN
(he's persuaded)
Now that you've jogged my memory...
(sips his drink)
...and set it on fire... I'll
drive.
JERRY
That's the spirit: all work and no
play makes Ben and Jerry dull boys.
Let's roll!
They clink glasses and drain their drinks. Audrey moves away,
as they start towards the door. She turns a corner as they
exit and walk away.
BENJAMIN
After dinner, Jer. Gotta spend some
quality time with the squaw.
They move out of sight. Audrey watches them go, thinking.

EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Re-establish. James Hurley's Harley is parked outside.
CUT TO:
INT. HAYWARD HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Donna escorts James into the living room, where Eileen and
Dr. Hayward are waiting.
DONNA
Mom, Dad... this is James... James
Hurley.
DR. HAYWARD
How do you do, James?
JAMES
Pleased to meet you, sir--Mrs.
Hayward.
EILEEN
James, very nice to meet you.
An awkward silence.
DR. HAYWARD
Hope you're hungry, James. Eileen's
been cooking up a storm.
Yes, sir.

JAMES

Another silence.
EILEEN
James, can I offer you something to
drink? We have soft drinks, fruit
punch, or sparkling cider.
JAMES
Fruit punch. That'd be good, thank
you.
DONNA
I'll get it, mom.
Donna exits to the kitchen.
DR. HAYWARD
Have a seat, James.


57.

EILEEN
You fellas go ahead and sit at the
table. I'll go check on the roast.
Eileen drives her chair towards the kitchen. James and Dr.
Hayward move to the dining room table and take their seats.
Donna returns from the kitchen and sets down a glass in front
of James.
DONNA
Here's your fruit punch, James.
JAMES
Thanks, Donna.
DR. HAYWARD
I don't believe I know your
parents, James.
JAMES
No, sir. My dad died when I was
ten. My mom... travels a lot.
DONNA
Ed Hurley down at the Gas Farm is
James' uncle.
DR. HAYWARD
His wife is the lady with the
patch?
JAMES
That's my Aunt Nadine. She's a real
character.
EILEEN'S VOICE
(from the kitchen)
Will? Can you give me a hand?
DR. HAYWARD
Excuse me, James.
He exits into the kitchen. Donna whispers across the table to
James.
DONNA
(more intimately)
We can talk after dinner.
JAMES
It's good to see you.


58.

DONNA
(smiles warmly)
It's good to see you, too.
CUT TO:
EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Mike and Bobby pull up outside in Bobby's car. They see
James' bike parked in front.
BOBBY
That bastard.
MIKE
First your girlfriend, then mine.
BOBBY
Too bad we can only kill him once.
He lights a cigarette. They drive slowly off. The rear
brakelights disappear into the darkness. The wind howls.
CUT TO:
INT. DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
We hear a soft, cool be-bop tune. Lights are low. A pair of
strange, green orthopedic shoes dance expertly into view and
execute a few boss moves. We widen out to see Dr. Jacoby in
his fifties-style, Hawaiian-themed rec room. He picks up his
mail and sifts through it, continuing to dance. He stops
suddenly when he comes across a slightly bulky plain manilla
envelope. He opens the envelope and finds a single audio
cassette tape, without a case. Written on the cartridge are
the words...
"TO DR. JACOBY, WITH LOVE, LAURA"
Overcome with amazement, he instantly turns off his stereo,
punches eject, removes the tape that was playing, inserts
Laura's tape and hits play.
LAURA'S VOICE
(from tape)
Hey, what's up, doc? Ha-ha... it's
Thursday afternoon about four
o'clock and I'm so bored I'm making
you this tape on the pretty little
tape recorder you gave me...
We hear background noises on the tape; ambient sound from a
department store.


59.

Dr. Jacoby nervously starts eating malted milkballs from a
bowl on his desk, cruching them in a single bite.
LAURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
...and as you probably already
noticed, I'm gonna mail it to you
in the ugly little plain envelope
you gave me... for, what was the
word you used? "confidentiality's
sake." ...this is kind of fun...
First, you're always bugging me to
tell you what my dreams are--let me
tell you about this one I had last
night: it was a doozy.
He reaches into his desk and takes out a pair of headphones,
which he puts on.
LAURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
...I was in this strange room and
there was this little man and this
older man I'd never seen before
either, but they both seemed to
know me... there was music... and I
was telling all my secrets to the
older man...
He plugs the headphones in and we no longer hear her voice.
As he listens and chomps on the milkballs, his face registers
a whole gamut of emotions.
FADE OUT:
THE END
